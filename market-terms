Republic's Secondary Market Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
</h1>
<h2 class='c-secondaryTitle'>
General
</h2>
<p>
Republic’s Secondary Market was created by Republic Investment Services LLC (“<span class='u-fontWeight600 u-whiteSpaceNowrap'>Republic</span>”) and is operated in its sole and absolute discretion. No broker-dealer or FINRA member firm is or has
been involved in the development or operation of Republic’s Secondary Market. No affiliate of Republic
participates in Republic's Secondary Market in a brokerage, investment advisory, money transmission,
trust or custody capacity.
</p>
<p>
The issuers, each of which are unaffiliated with Republic unless otherwise noted, and such issuers’
securities listed here, are not listed on any national stock exchange or other regulated securities
market.
</p>
<p>
Republic is not compensated by any party for maintaining, operating or otherwise providing services
associated with Republic's Secondary Market. Republic is incurring all costs associated with the Escrow
Agent without reimbursement or other remuneration.
</p>
<p>
Republic is not registered, licensed, or supervised as a broker dealer or investment adviser by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), or any
other financial regulatory authority or licensed to provide any financial advice or services. Republic's
Secondary Market is not a registered national securities exchange, Alternative Trading Platform regulated
pursuant to Rule ATS or securities information processor. Republic has no fiduciary duty or duties of care
to uses of Republic's Secondary Market.
</p>
<p>
The information provided on Republic’s Secondary Market pages (www.republic.com/market and its branches)
do not consist of firm quotes, but rather a list of securities, previously sold through the affiliated
Republic platform, the holders of which have indicated a desire to buy or sell and a mechanism for
potential purchasers and seller to communicate with potential counterparties.
<span class='u-textDecorationUnderline'>
Republic does not assure any participant that any particular transaction will ever occur.
</span>
All transactions between participants must be executed by the participants independent of Republic or any
of its respective affiliates. Any implied or approximate valuation provided via Republic's Secondary
Market is provided through a pre-determined formula, which shall be disclosed to all participants where
relevant and does not constitute investment advice, a research report or the actual valuation of an issuer
or a security.
</p>
<p>
All applicable state and federal securities laws (including the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation
provisions) apply to any offer made or transaction consummated using Republic’s Secondary Market.
</p>
<p>
The securities of certain Issuers which are listed on the Republic Secondary Market<span class='u-fontWeight600 u-whiteSpaceNowrap'>are not necessarily</span>eligible to transact; only securities and their Issuers which have met all terms and conditions (as
further defined below) will be considered “<span class='u-fontWeight600 u-whiteSpaceNowrap'>Eligible Securities</span>”. Only the Eligible Securities may transact. Eligibility is temporal and may change from time to time.
</p>
<p>
Each Issuer of Eligible Securities has engaged Brassica Services, LLC, a SEC-registered transfer agent
and an affiliate of Republic as the registrar and transfer agent of its securities. The seller must
provide the contact information for the issuer, and any engaged transfer agent, to any prospective
purchaser.
</p>
<p>
Any participant in a transaction that is a broker-dealer, an associated person of a broker-dealer, or who
has a state securities license is responsible for identifying that fact to Republic and any prospective
participants prior to participating on this platform.
</p>
<p>
Two-sided quotes in which a participant indicates an indication to buy a security at one price and an
indication to sell that same security at a higher price are prohibited.
</p>
<p>
The registration requirements of the federal securities laws apply to all offers and sales through
Republic's Secondary Market absent an available exception or exemption.
</p>

Governing Law; Venue and Jurisdiction; Arbitration
</h3>
<p>
By visiting or using the Site and/or the Service, you agree that the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to any principles of conflict of laws that would require or permit the application of the
laws of any other jurisdiction, will govern these Terms of Use. By agreeing to the Terms of Use and using
the Website and the Service, you agree to agree to the binding arbitration provisions set forth in these
Terms of Use and submit to personal jurisdiction in the Federal courts located in New York City for all
purposes, and you agree to waive, to maximum extent permitted by law, any right to a trial by jury for
any matter.
</p>
<p>
Either party may, at its sole election, require that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for
resolution of a Claim be final and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in New York,
NY. As used in this provision, “Claim” shall include any past, present, or future claim, dispute, or
controversy involving you (or persons claiming through or connected with you), on the one hand, and
Republic (or officers, directors, employees, contractors, managers, members or other persons claiming
through or connected with Republic), on the other hand, relating to or arising out of the Site, these
Terms of use and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from any of the
foregoing, including the validity or enforceability of this arbitration provision, provided that this
provision shall not apply to any Claims arising under Federal securities laws. Claims are subject to
arbitration regardless of whether they arise from contract; tort (intentional or otherwise); a
constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or otherwise. Claims include (without
limitation) matters arising as initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or
otherwise. The scope of this arbitration provision is to be given the broadest possible interpretation
that is enforceable.
</p>
<p>
The party initiating arbitration shall do so with the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) or
JAMS. The arbitration shall be conducted according to, and the location of the arbitration shall be
determined in accordance with, the rules and policies of the administrator selected, except to the extent
the rules conflict with this arbitration provision or any countervailing law. In the case of a conflict
between the rules and policies of the administrator and this arbitration provision, this arbitration
provision shall control, subject to countervailing law, unless all parties to the arbitration consent to
have the rules and policies of the administrator apply.
</p>
<p>
If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all the administrator’s filing costs and administrative fees (other
than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing
fees) shall be paid in accordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in accordance with
countervailing law if contrary to the administrator’s rules. We shall pay the administrator’s hearing
fees for one full day of arbitration hearings. Fees for hearings that exceed one day will be paid by the
party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator’s rules or applicable law require otherwise, or you
request that we pay them and we agree to do so. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorney’s
fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees,
these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.
</p>
<p>
Within 30 days of a final award by the arbitrator, a party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a
three-arbitrator panel selected according to the rules of the arbitrator administrator. In the event of
such an appeal, an opposing party may cross-appeal within 30 days after notice of the appeal. The panel
will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that are appealed. Costs and conduct of any
appeal shall be governed by this arbitration provision and the administrator’s rules, in the same way as
the initial arbitration proceeding. Any award by the individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal,
and any panel award on appeal, shall be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the Federal
Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim that you may bring in Small Claims Court
or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS
(INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE
SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS
REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT.
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise provided in these Terms of Use or consented to in writing by all parties to the
arbitration, no party to the arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on
behalf of two or more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration unless those
persons are parties to a single transaction. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the
arbitration, an award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only,
and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not (i) determine the rights, obligations,
or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party,
or (ii) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator or
arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this provision, and any
attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and
unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this provision shall be determined exclusively by a court
and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.
</p>
<p>
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be
governed by and enforceable under the FAA. The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the
FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator may award damages or other types of relief
permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to the limitations set forth in this arbitration
provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply
in a court. The arbitrator shall take steps to reasonably protect confidential information.
</p>
<p>
This arbitration provision shall survive (i) suspension, termination, revocation, closure, or amendments
to these Terms of Use and the relationship of the parties; (ii) the bankruptcy or insolvency of any party
hereto or other party; and (iii) any transfer of any securities, to any other party. If any portion of
this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration
provision shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. If arbitration is brought on a class,
representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings included herein are finally
adjudicated to be unenforceable, then no arbitration shall be had. In no event shall any invalidation be
deemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this
arbitration provision.
</p>
<p>
If any provision of these Terms of Use conflicts with a provision contained in any subscription agreement,
share transfer agreement or similar agreement to which you and Republic are party, the terms of such other
agreement shall control and shall be deemed to supercede the provisions of these Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding anything set forth in these Terms of Use, either Republic or you may apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief without breach of the mandatory arbitration provisions set
forth above.
</p>
<p>
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE, BUT WILL
NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. THE PARTIES
HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT UPON ELECTION OF
ARBITRATION BY ANY PARTY. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE SHARES OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATED THERETO. THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS MADE UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.
</p>
<h3 class='u-fontWeight400'>
Indemnity
</h3>
<p>
You agree to indemnify and hold Republic, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their directors,
officers, agents, contractors, members, managers, partners and employees, harmless from and against any
loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising
out of or in connection with your User Content, any Third Party Content you post or share on or through

<p>
The failure of Republic to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not
constitute a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance. If any provision of these
Terms of Use is held invalid, the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect.
If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable,
then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity
and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
