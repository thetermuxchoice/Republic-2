<h2 style="text-align: center;">Engineered for transparency, flexibility, and security</h2><p>Rooted in a strong technical foundation that leverages blockchain technology, along with rigorously designed reporting requirements as a security regulated under US securities laws, the Republic Note is optimized for transparency and efficiency.</p><p>To date, the smart contracts for the Republic Note have been deployed, the digital assets minted on a test network, and the system's securities audited by a third-party vendor. The Republic Note was engineered to include the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>Access-Control Functionalities</strong><br>Enable smart contract functionalities that allow Republic to implement the on-chain compliant transfer restrictions necessary for legally compliant trading of digital securities.</li><li><strong>Transaction Fees</strong><br>Low fees to efficiently support dividend distributions using stablecoins, and for Republic to automate micro-transactions using the Republic Note to reward certain activities within the ecosystem in the future.</li><li><strong>Stablecoin Support</strong><br>On-chain stablecoin support enabling for tokens to be swapped atomically across various chains.</li><li><strong>Legal &amp; Business Flexibility</strong><br>Allow for regulator-requested smart contract functions (like freeze, clawback, mint, and burn functions) to handle crisis events like fraud or forking.</li><li><strong>Network Security</strong><br>Inclusion of security features that both sufficiently prevent forking and provide a remedy in such an event.</li><li><strong>Compatibility with the Republic Retail Platform</strong><br>Integration with Republic's existing legal and technology stack that includes KYC/AML, accreditation verification, payment processing, and distributions.</li></ul><p>Beyond the security features provided by its blockchain protocol, the Republic Note is offered under Reg CF—effectively requiring Republic Core to file an annual report that provides transparent and accessible updates on our business.</p>

No offer to buy securities under any regulatory exemption, including Regulation A, can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received until an offering statement is qualified with the SEC for a Regulation A offering. Any offer to buy securities may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of its acceptance is given after the qualification date.

How will dividends be distributed to Republic Note holders?
</h4>
<p>Republic Note Holders receive dividend distributions from the Dividend Pool each time it reaches a threshold amount of $2 million. The threshold amount is subject to change at the sole and reasonable discretion of the Republic management team. In the event of a dividend distribution, each Republic Note entitles its holder to a pro-rata amount from the Dividend Pool, after operational transaction fees have been deducted. The intention is for dividend distributions to be made in the form of an eligible digital asset, but may be required to make distributions in other currencies. Republic Note holders will be made aware of upcoming dividend distributions at least four weeks prior to such an event.</p>

<p>Republic Core’s ability to develop and operate the Republic Notes may depend on technology and intellectual property rights that Republic Core may hold or license from unaffiliated third parties. If for any reason Republic Core were to fail to comply with its obligations under applicable license agreements, adequately protect its owned intellectual property, or fail to obtain and maintain rights to the technology and intellectual property that the Republic Note Smart Contract and Republic Notes require, this could have an adverse effect on Republic Core’s operations and financial condition.</p>

<p>A significant portion of our recurring revenue is derived from two Clients, both of which are affiliates.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to provide such services on terms that would be consistent with those offered on an arm’s-length basis to independent third parties. For example, it is our intention to help strengthen the entire Republic Ecosystem by providing valuable products and services. But it is conceivable that our affiliates, including with the support of Republic Parent, could require us to provide such products and services but not compensate us at market rates, while hampering our ability to object to such compensation or to stop providing such goods and services. Consequently, adverse performance by, or unreasonable requirements imposed on us by, Republic Core affiliates, including with the support of Republic Parent, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</p>

<p>Republic Parent, Republic Core’s Client affiliates, and Republic Core intend to continue to make investments in people and technologies to support the growth of the Site and the Republic Ecosystem and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and services, improve operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, Republic Parent, Republic Core’s Client affiliates and Republic Core may need to engage in equity, debt or other types of financings to secure additional funds including, but not limited to, Republic Core issuing additional Republic Notes. Any financing that Republic Parent, Republic Core’s Client affiliates or Republic Core secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for Republic Parent, Republic Core’s Client affiliates or Republic Core to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions, or to make the necessary capital investments to grow the Republic Ecosystem and the Republic Core business.

<p>Republic Parent owns, and will be able to exercise voting rights with respect to, all of our outstanding Class A limited liability company membership interests. The only class of membership interests that has any rights to vote or to govern the Company are the Class A limited liability company membership interests. Class A membership interests are the only interests which have a right to Dividend Distributions not related to Republic Core proceeds. In addition, in the event of a liquidation of the Company, the Class A member will receive 100% of the Company’s intellectual property assets, 100% of any fixed quarterly payments paid or due to the Company and 80% of any residual assets of the Company. As the holders of Class B limited liability company membership interests, the holders of Republic Notes will not have any voting rights and will only have rights to Republic Core Proceeds and 20% of the residual of any remaining assets in the event the Company is liquidated. As a result, Republic Parent will continue to hold all of the voting power of our outstanding equity interests following each offering of Republic Notes. This gives Republic Parent effective control over our decision-making. Republic Parent is entitled to vote its Class A limited liability company membership interests in its own interest, which may not always be in the interests of, and could be adverse to the interests of, holders of Republic Notes. In the event of the liquidation of Republic Core prior to the repayment of all amounts owed to Republic Parent, as a debtor, Republic Parent will have priority and therefore would be entitled to repayment prior to Republic Note holders. Accordingly, if Republic Core dissolves or liquidates and if amounts owed to Republic Parent exceed Republic Core’s available assets, Republic Parent will receive those assets with priority to Class A Membership Interest holders, i.e., Republic Note holders, even if those assets would otherwise constitute Distributable Assets.</p>

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
<p>On November 12, 2021, Universal Music Group (“UMG”) commenced, UMG RECORDINGS, INC. v. OPENDEAL INC. D/B/A REPUBLIC, United States District Court, Southern District of New York (21. Civ. 9358 (AT)). UMG asserted claims for trademark infringement, unfair competition and false designation of origin, in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1114, 1125 et seq., and parallel claims under New York state and common law, moving for an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Republic Parent from using the trademarks “Republic” and “Republic Music” in connection with music-related goods and services during the pendency of the litigation. The Court denied the motion for preliminary injunction on July 5, 2022. Opulous Ltd.,, a former client of Republic Crowd-Invest was joined as a co-defendant by UMG in the fourth quarter of 2022. Discovery will end in March of 2023. Republic Parent initially sought a settlement in pre-complaint discussion but has not pursued a settlement as it is currently in the position of advantage following the Court’s denial of the preliminary injunction request. A loss of this claim could prevent the Republic Ecosystem from facilitating in and participating in certain types of activities under the REPUBLIC name, which could have a detrimental effect on such prospective activities success and therefore possibly reduce Republic Core Proceeds and in turn a Republic Note holders return.</p>

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
<p>Republic Core is subject to applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. The laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are evolving, may impose inconsistent or conflicting standards among jurisdictions, can be subject to significant change and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, a new EU data protection regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective on May 25, 2018, and, in addition to imposing stringent obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, authorizes fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater, for some types of violations. Further, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that will, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. </p><p>The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action that may increase related litigation. A third version of the regulations implementing the CCPA was released on March 11, 2020, and it is possible that it will be amended again before it is finalized. Additionally, Proposition 24, a California state ballot initiative which seeks to enshrine more provisions in California state law ensuring that consumers can direct businesses not to share their personal data, removes the set time period in which violations of this privacy law could be corrected without penalty and creates a dedicated agency to enforce state privacy laws was approved by the majority of voters during the November 3, 2020 election and will therefore be effectuated in the future. We cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA and Proposition 24 on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.</p><p>In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose self-regulatory standards from time to time. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards or to facilitate compliance with such standards. We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and standards relating to privacy and data protection in various jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of data, or associated requirements, could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to achieve in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and which could limit our ability to develop new features. Because the interpretation and application of laws, standards, contractual obligations and other obligations relating to privacy and data protection are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, standards, contractual obligations and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices, our privacy, data protection, or data security policies or procedures, or the features of the Site.</p><p>Any violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or the safeguarding of private information could subject our Company or any members to fines, penalties or other regulatory actions, as well as to civil actions by affected parties. Any such violations could result in negative publicity and harm to our or our members’ reputations. Any such violations also could adversely affect the ability of Republic Parent, Republic Core and other affiliates in the Republic Ecosystem to further develop, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions, and could also negatively affect the Republic Notes.

<p>Republic Core primarily relies on trade secret protections and confidentiality or license agreements with its employees, members, and others to protect its intellectual property rights. However, the steps it takes to protect its intellectual property rights may be inadequate. In order to protect its intellectual property rights, Republic Core may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of its intellectual property. Furthermore, its efforts to enforce intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of those and related rights. The counterparties of such disputes could prevail, or Republic Core could incur substantial legal expenses even if it were to prevail. Republic Core’s failure to secure, protect, and enforce its intellectual property rights, or the cost of successfully or unsuccessfully seeking to protect those rights, could adversely affect its business. In addition, any litigation may divert the attention of Republic Core’s management and key personnel from the further development of the Republic Core business, which would adversely affect your Republic Notes.</p>

Also, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications that provide individuals with access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects or business. The harm may be immediate and may disseminate rapidly and broadly, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.</p>

<p>We continue to face advanced and persistent attacks on our information infrastructure where we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive/confidential data relating to our operations. These attacks may include sophisticated malware (viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs) and phishing emails that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. These intrusions sometimes may be zero-day malware that are difficult to identify because they are not included in the signature set of commercially available antivirus scanning programs. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our customers or other third-parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Additionally, sophisticated software and applications that we produce or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the information infrastructure. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information infrastructure systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of critical data and performance delays, which in turn could adversely affect our business.</p>

<p>Our business requires the collection, transmission and retention of personally identifiable information, in various information technology systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services. The integrity and protection of that data is critical to us. The information, security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation are increasingly demanding. Our systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and customer and employee expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so. A breach in the security of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits. Additionally, a significant theft, loss or misappropriation of, or access to, customers’ or other proprietary data or other breach of our information technology systems could result in fines, legal claims or proceedings.</p>

<p>The regulation of individual data is changing rapidly, and in unpredictable ways. A change in regulation could adversely affect our business, including causing our business model to no longer be viable. Costs associated with information security – such as investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud – could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. If any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
<p>Republic Core will periodically, and at least twice in any twelve-month period (on June 30 and December 31), calculate the total amount of Republic Core Proceeds it has received since its last Distribution and, whenever this calculation yields a Distributable Amount that exceeds the $2,000,000 Threshold Amount (or a smaller amount that Republic Core deems, in its sole business discretion, advisable to distribute), Republic Core will issue Dividend Distributions to Republic Note holders. See “Distribution Policy.” The calculation will include all Republic Core Proceeds all proceeds received by Republic Core since the last Distribution was made (not including any amounts already distributed). The basis for each Dividend Distribution calculation is the amount of available Republic Core Proceeds. We will receive Republic Core Proceeds from time to time, if and when a Client receives cash proceeds from securities or carried interests that it has acquired in the normal course of its business. However, we cannot predict when or how often Clients will receive such cash proceeds, or in what amounts. Moreover, Republic Core will not receive Republic Core Proceeds from any entity in the Republic Ecosystem other than the two Clients unless and until Republic Core enters into agreements with such entities. As a result, there can be no assurance as to when or how often, or in what amounts, we will have Republic Core Proceeds that would be distributable as Dividend Distributions. In addition, if we receive Republic Core Proceeds, but these proceeds do not exceed the $2,000,000 Threshold Amount (or a smaller amount that Republic Core deems, in its sole business discretion, is advisable to distribute), then there will be no Dividend Distributions made, and the next earliest time any of such Republic Core Proceeds might be distributed would be following the next Dividend Distribution calculation time – and then only if the $2,000,000 Threshold Amount (or a smaller amount that Republic Core deems, in its sole business discretion, is advisable to distribute), is met at that time. In the event of a Reduced Threshold Amount Dividend Distribution event, the accrued Distributable Amount would be reset to $0, possibly extending the time until the Threshold Amount was next reached, unless a Reduced Threshold Amount event were again declared by Republic Core. As a consequence of the foregoing, Dividend Distributions made to Republic Note holders may not be paid frequently, or at all, and if paid may not constitute large payments.</p>

<p>A total of 800,000,000 Republic Notes will be generated. These will be divisible into various categories, depending on how quickly and with what likelihood they will be issued by us. See “Description of Securities – Republic Note Supply and Economics”. Issued Republic Notes are eligible to receive Dividend Distributions. As described in our Dividend Distribution policy, when a Dividend Distribution is to be made, the total amount to be distributed will be divided among all Issued Republic Notes outstanding as of the time we take a “snapshot” of all outstanding Issued Republic Notes (thereby, creating a time one must be a holder of record to receive a Dividend Distribution) for purposes of that Dividend Distribution. See “Distribution Policy.” Therefore, the Individual Distribution Amount that any particular holder of Issued Republic Notes would receive in a particular Distribution would depend substantially on the total number of Issued Republic Notes outstanding at the snapshot time for that Distribution. Additionally, in the event of a Reduced Threshold Amount Dividend Distribution event were to occur, the accrued Distributable Amount would be reset to $0, possibly extending the time until the Threshold Amount was next reached, unless a Reduced Threshold Amount event were again declared by Republic Core.</p><p>Up to 16,724,475 Republic Notes may be issued in the Offering. But substantially more Republic Notes would be available for us to issue in the future or through other offerings occurring concurrently. The sizes of any Dividend Distributions you may receive may decrease as we issue additional Republic Notes. The amount of Issued Republic Notes outstanding from time to time is substantially within our control — and increases in such amount may substantially dilute the Dividend Distribution amounts payable to you.</p><p>At the close of the Offering and any concurrent offerings, if all of the Republic Notes in the Offering and any concurrent offerings are sold, approximately 355,913,170 Republic Notes will be outstanding.</p>

We anticipate, given the history of courts’ close scrutiny of individual-facing arbitration provisions and jury trial waivers, that future courts will continue to review and consider the enforceability of such provisions and, as courts continue to evolve their thinking on this issue, it is possible that certain state or federal courts may further limit the enforceability of such provisions. For further discussion, see the section of this offering circular captioned “Plan of Distribution—Arbitration and Waiver of Jury Trial.” However, we believe that contractual mandatory arbitration and pre-dispute jury trial waiver provisions are generally enforceable, including under the laws of the State of New York, which laws govern the subscription agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual mandatory arbitration provision pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision, courts will generally consider whether the visibility of the jury trial waiver provision within the agreement is sufficiently prominent such that a party knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial.

Moreover, the Republic Notes and the Republic Note Smart Contract (and any technology, including blockchain technology, on which they rely, such as the Algorand blockchain) may be the target of malicious attacks seeking to identify and exploit technological weaknesses, which may result in the loss or theft of Republic Notes or other harms. These attacks may include, but may not be limited to, the following:</p><p>●</p><p>A “Finney attack” occurs when an attacker enters into a transaction but does not announce it to the network. In such a case, the attacker can double-spend Republic Notes by transferring them to another user (for example, a merchant website) and then creating a new block of those same Republic Notes. For such an attack to be successful, the new block must be released so that it is added to the blockchain before the other user engages in a transaction. Once the block is accepted, the other user’s transaction will not be accepted. Typically, users who accept “quick transactions” (which are accepted before the counterparty can confirm that the transaction has been written to the correct version of the blockchain) are vulnerable to this type of attack.</p><p>●</p><p>A “Sybil attack” refers to a situation where a single unique user masquerades as multiple independent network nodes or users. This type of attack is difficult to defend against, even in theory, and may be used to game systems where distributions of rewards are designed to be based on unique user identities. Malicious users who adopt this sort of attack can subvert the system to receive Republic Notes as rewards, and thereby undermine the system generally.</p><p>These and other sorts of attacks may increase in frequency as more Republic Notes are distributed, if they become more valuable, and in particular if they are held by an increasing number of members. Republic Core may attempt to take measures to increase security on the Republic Note Smart Contract, but there can be no assurance that any such measures will be successful, and they will inevitably depend in large part on member behavior. As a result, there may be a number of successful attacks against the Republic Note Smart Contract and Republic Notes and their holders. Such attacks may adversely affect the Republic Note Smart Contract in the specific ways described above, by reducing trust in the integrity of the Site and the Republic Notes, creating bad publicity, and ultimately reducing demand for the Republic Notes.</p>

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
<p>Blockchain technology, which is sometimes referred to as “distributed ledger technology,” is a relatively new, untested and evolving technology that represents a novel combination of several concepts, some of which may be present or absent in varying degrees across differing types of digital assets. These aspects include a distributed database or ledger that represents the total ownership of the assets at any one time, novel methods of authenticating transactions using cryptography across distributed network nodes, differing methods of incentivizing authentication by the use of rewards, and, in some cases, hard limits on the aggregate amount of assets that may be issued.</p><p>Accordingly, the further development and future viability of digital assets such as the Republic Note is uncertain, and a variety of challenges may prevent wider adoption. Examples of these challenges include the following:</p><p>●</p><p>Scalability is a challenge for blockchains, because addition of records to a blockchain requires the network to achieve consensus through a validator mechanism, and delays and bottlenecks in the clearance of transactions may result.</p><p>●</p><p>To the extent incentive payments are used to incentivize the validation of a transaction a blockchain, these fees may spike during times of high transaction volume. Because Republic Notes are securities, these incentive payments could also potentially raise regulatory issues related to whether the recipient of the fees is required to register as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act. We believe that these rewards do not warrant a validator registering as a broker-dealer; however, there can be no assurance that regulatory agencies will agree with our position.</p><p>●</p><p>In the case of many blockchains, during the validation process, competing forks of the blockchain may arise. As a result, a block is often not considered to be irreversibly included in the blockchain until several additional blocks have been added to it, and occasionally blocks with a handful of confirmations can be dropped and modified. Applications built on top of a blockchain that do not wait a sufficient period before treating the blockchain as permanently written may lose assets and funds in exchange for blockchain payments that are never completed. The Algorand blockchain has been designed to avoid forking problems that affect other blockchains. However, there can be no assurance that the Algorand design will prevent all forks, and there may still be unexpected forks in the Algorand blockchain.</p><p>●</p><p>Because the blockchain has no gatekeepers, malicious users cannot be banned from the network. These users may drive out honest users through repeated attacks or by malicious behavior on applications that permit user-to-user interaction.</p><p>Moreover, advances in cryptography or other technical advances, such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to Republic Notes, the Republic Note Smart Contract or the Algorand blockchain, by undermining or vitiating the cryptographic consensus mechanisms that underlie the blockchain protocols. Similarly, legislatures and regulatory agencies could prohibit the use of current or future cryptographic protocols, which could limit the utility of Republic Notes, the Republic Note Smart Contract or the Algorand blockchain.</p>

<p>Due to the decentralized nature and governance structure of the Algorand blockchain, no central authority or system administrator exists with the power to preclude all potentially adverse changes to Algorand blockchain protocols. Consequently, Republic Core is unable to assure that the Algorand protocols will continue to be compatible with and supportive of the ownership and use of Republic Notes. For example, the possibility exists that a malicious actor could obtain, and stake, a supermajority of Algo Republic Notes on the Algorand blockchain, such that the actor is able to alter governing protocols, prevent the confirmation of new transactions, reverse previously completed transactions, or otherwise exercise control in a manner adverse to the continued operability of the Republic Notes or the interests of Republic Note holders. Such changes to the underlying protocols on which Republic Core’s technology relies could render the Republic Notes inoperable or reduce their utility or attractiveness.

We do not intend to engage a transfer agent with respect to the Republic Notes, in part because there is no existing transfer agent that we are aware of able to perform relevant functions related to the Republic Notes, and in part because the types of activities a transfer agent would normally engage in are performed automatically on the blockchain.</p><p>It is possible that a regulator would disagree with this position that a transfer agent is unnecessary and therefore determine that we cannot avail ourselves of the limited ongoing reporting obligations available under Regulation A. If that were to happen, and if the services of a transfer agent were not readily available for Republic Notes, Republic Core might be required to file the full set of reports required of a reporting company. If so, we would need to spend considerable additional time, effort and expense preparing and providing the required reports. This could have an adverse effect on our operations, and would require significant attention from management, which in turn could affect our business and the Republic Notes. In anticipation of the Offering, Republic Core has undertaken an analysis of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and determined it is unlikely at this time or in the near future that Republic Core would be required to becoming a “reporting company” without regard to the Regulation A, Tier 2, reporting scheme; however, if this analysis were to change, or if a regulator were to disagree, the cost and time it would take to register the Republic Notes and abide by the reporting requirements applicable to a registered security could have a material adverse effect on our operations, specifically with respect to our internal controls, legal and regulatory costs and liquidity related to funding such activities.</p>

<p>We have taken the position that neither the Company nor the blockchain should be viewed as an exchange or an ATS, primarily because each proposed transaction involving Notes on the network will be individually negotiated and implemented. It is possible that the SEC or another regulator would disagree with our position. If so, we could be forced to register the network and/or the blockchain as an exchange or ATS and comply with applicable law, which could lead to significant costs to Republic Core and could force Republic Core to change or cease its operations.

<p>Certain activities conducted with respect to the Republic Notes could be viewed as triggering a requirement that the Company or the blockchain register as a clearing agency. We do not believe that such registration is required, but it is possible that the SEC or another regulator would disagree with that position. If so, we or the blockchain could be required to register as a clearing agency, and comply with law applicable to clearing agencies, which could lead to significant costs to us or the blockchain, and could force us to change or cease our operation or support of the blockchain. It could also lead to considerable uncertainty as to how we or the blockchain would comply with regulation, which would likely result in a need for a relatively long registration process and could ultimately prove prohibitive to our business model.

<p>We believe that no Republic Core entity is a money transmitter or a money services business.

This could lead to significant changes with respect to our operations, how the Republic Notes are structured, how they are purchased, subscribed for and sold and other issues, and would greatly increase our costs in creating and facilitating transactions in the Notes. It could also lead to the termination of the Republic Notes or a decrease in their value. In addition, a regulator could take action against Republic Core if it views the Republic Notes and/or the Republic Note Smart Contract as a violation of existing law.

It is possible, however, that the New York State Department of Financial Services could disagree with our position.</a>
<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
<p>We are not licensed to conduct a virtual currency business in New York or any other state. We have, however, taken the position that the State of New York’s BitLicense Regulatory Framework does not apply to the offer and sale of securities like the Republic Notes—including issuances pursuant to SAFE-STs personally issued to persons located in New York. We are also taking the position that the securities offered pursuant to this offering circular are “covered securities” as that term is used in Section 18 of the Securities Act, and as a result, the BitLicense Regulatory Framework is preempted under federal law with respect to Republic Notes offered under this offering circular. It is possible that the New York State Department of Financial Services could disagree with our position. If we were deemed to be conducting an unlicensed virtual currency business in New York, we could be subject to significant additional regulation and/or regulatory consequences. This could lead to significant changes with respect to the operation or planned operation of the Republic Note Smart Contract, how the Republic Notes are structured, how they are purchased subscribed for and sold, and other issues, and would greatly increase costs in creating and facilitating transactions in the Republic Notes. It could lead to the termination of the Republic Notes or decreases in the value of the Republic Notes. In addition, a regulator could take action adverse to us, users of the Note Smart Contract, the Note Smart Contract itself or the Republic Notes. Any of these outcomes would negatively affect us, the Note Smart Contract, including its further development, and the value of the Republic Notes and/or could cause us to cease operations.</p><p>Currently, New York is the only state that requires a license to operate a virtual currency business, but it is possible that other states may require licenses in the future. If additional states begin to regulate virtual currency businesses as New York has, or impose other regulatory restrictions, and take the position that we are operating regulated virtual currency businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in those states, or for holders of the Republic Notes to engage in any activities related to the Republic Notes in those states, which could affect the value of the Republic Notes. This could also lead to the potential legal consequences described above with regard to New York. </p>

Foreign data protection, privacy, other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States.

In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.</p><p>The growth of our business may increase the potential of violating applicable laws and regulations. The risk of our Company being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations (in the United States or abroad) is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and are open to a variety of interpretations.
