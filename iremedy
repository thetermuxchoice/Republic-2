Why invest in iRemedy Healthcare?
</h4>
<p>We believe there are two great reasons to invest in iRemedy Healthcare. &nbsp;First, healthcare costs in America are among the highest in the world and a major factor in that cost is the non-competitive nature of medical supply sales. &nbsp;Investing in iRemedy Healthcare is a way to participate in a new model of lowering medical supply costs and subsequently, lowering healthcare costs in America. &nbsp;Secondly, the medical supply industry is one of the largest markets in the country with sales exceeding $100B. &nbsp;The timing is excellent for a new AI-driven marketplace platform to achieve continued rapid sales growth.</p>

The actual or perceived failure to address or comply with applicable Data Protection Laws by us or our customers, partners, or vendors could increase our compliance and operational costs, expose us to regulatory scrutiny, actions, fines, and penalties, result in reputational harm, lead to a loss of customers, reduce the use of our services, result in litigation and liability, have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results, or otherwise result in other material harm to our business.

We are a “Business Associate” as defined under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, or OCR, may impose significant penalties on a Business Associate for a failure to comply with an applicable requirement of HIPAA.

Penalties will vary significantly depending on factors such as the date of the violation, whether the Business Associate knew or should have known of the failure to comply, or whether the Business Associate’s failure to comply was due to willful neglect. Currently, these penalties include civil monetary penalties for violations. A single breach incident can result in violations of multiple requirements, resulting in possible penalties in excess of pre-set annual limits. Further, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal monetary penalty and imprisonment up to one year. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and further increase if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. The U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, is responsible for criminal prosecutions under HIPAA. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals’ health information. Furthermore, in the event of a breach as defined by HIPAA, the Business Associate may have to comply with specific reporting requirements under HIPAA regulations.

The security measures that we and our third-party vendors and subcontractors have in place in an effort to ensure compliance with privacy and data protection laws may not protect our facilities and systems from security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and human errors or other similar events. Under the HITECH Act, as a Business Associate, we may also be liable for privacy and security breaches and failures of our subcontractors. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our agreements with our subcontractors, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. A breach of privacy or security of individually identifiable health information by a subcontractor may result in an enforcement action, including criminal and civil liability, against us. We are not able to predict the extent of the impact such incidents may have on our business. Our failure to comply may result in criminal and civil liability because the potential for enforcement action against Business Associates is now greater. Enforcement actions against us could be costly and could interrupt regular operations, which may adversely affect our business. While we have not received any notices of violation of the applicable privacy and data protection laws and believe we are in compliance with such laws, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such notices in the future. There is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators, and others regarding data privacy and security issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data privacy and security laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentification, anonymization, or pseudonymization of health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy.

Applicable Data Protection Laws may also include state medical privacy laws, including those related to mental health and substance use treatment, and the provision of healthcare services, as well as federal and state consumer protection laws. These laws may not be preempted by HIPAA, may be more protective than HIPAA, and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and partners and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and states’ attorneys general to regulate the Processing of personal or personally identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content. The FTC in particular has approved consent decrees resolving complaints and their resulting investigations into the privacy and security practices of a number of online social media companies. These reviews can and have resulted in changes to our solutions and policies, and could result in additional changes in the future. If we are unable to comply with any such reviews or decrees that result in recommendations or binding changes, or if the recommended changes result in degradation of our solutions, our business could be harmed.

In addition, U.S. states have begun to introduce more comprehensive Data Protection Laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect in January 2020 and established a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours that expands the scope of personal information and provides new privacy rights for California residents. These changes required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, which may increase the likelihood and cost of data breach litigation. Additionally, on November 3, 2020, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA by, among other things, creating a dedicated privacy regulatory agency, requiring businesses to implement data minimization and data integrity principles, and imposing additional requirements for contracts addressing the processing of personal information. Moreover, the CPRA calls for additional regulations to be implemented before the law becomes fully operative on January 1, 2023. These changes may result in further uncertainty with respect to privacy, data protection and information security issues and will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The enactment of the CCPA has prompted similar legislative developments in other states, which could create the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. The federal government is also considering comprehensive privacy legislation.

We also expect that there will continue to be new or amended Data Protection Laws proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in the European Union, or EU. The GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and requires businesses subject to it to give more detailed disclosures about how they collect, use, and share personal information; contractually commit to data protection measures in contracts; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain data breaches; obtain consent to collect sensitive personal information such as health information; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals’ data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct, and delete their personal information. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA, including the United States. A recent judicial decision from the EU and recent announcements from European regulators regarding transfers of personal information outside of the EEA have increased the legal risks and liabilities, and compliance and operational costs, of lawfully making such transfers. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, restrictions, or prohibitions on data processing, and fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of worldwide annual revenue. If our business continues to expand in Europe, complying with the GDPR would entail significant costs and increase our liability risks.

New or amended Data Protection Laws, and changes in the interpretation of existing Data Protection Laws and our Data Protection Obligations (defined below), could impair our, or our customers’, our partners’, or our vendors’ ability to Process personal information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are or may be subject to the terms of our internal and external policies, representations, publications, frameworks, self-regulatory standards, and industry certification commitments (collectively, Privacy Policies), and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection and information security (collectively, Data Protection Obligations), including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), the rules imposed by credit card brands (e.g., VISA and Mastercard), and Security Organization Control 2 certification commitments. We strive to comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies, and Data Protection Obligations, but we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so, in which case we may be subject to and suffer a material harm to our business. For example, in the event we fail to comply with the PCI-DSS, we could be in breach of our obligations under customer and other contracts. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our personnel, customers, partners, or vendors do not comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies, and Data Protection Obligations. We may be subject to and suffer material harm to our business if our Privacy Policies are, in whole or part, found to be inaccurate, incomplete, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. In addition, any such failure or perceived failure could result in public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, which may cause us material reputational harm.

In view of applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations imposing complex and burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty in their interpretation and compliance, we have faced and may face challenges in addressing and complying with them, and fundamentally changing our business activities, Privacy Policies, and practices, and may expend significant resources in an effort to do so, any of which could result in material harm to business, financial condition, results of operations, or other harm

Further, our customers may expect us to comply with more stringent privacy, data protection, and information security requirements than those imposed by applicable Data Protection Laws, and we may be obligated contractually to comply with additional or different standards relating to our handling or protection of data on or by our offerings. For example, our mobile application is distributed through third-party platforms such as those operated by Apple and Google. These third parties may impose technical and privacy, data protection, and information security requirements on companies that distribute applications through their platforms. These requirements are subject to change and may adversely impact our ability to Process personal information. Complying with these requirements may cause us to incur additional expense, and the failure to comply with these requirements may cause us to lose access to the app store and users, and our business would be harmed.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
We have a history of operating losses and have incurred cash flow deficits. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported net losses of $19,483,473 and $9,634,255, respectively, and positive cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 of $2,448,188 and negative cash flow from operation activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $10,426,823. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we generated revenues of $50,227,530, reported net losses of $14,847,660, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $597,749. As noted in our condensed consolidated financial statements, as of June 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $62,340,195. We anticipate that we may continue to report losses and cash flow may prove unstable for the foreseeable future. Our management has concluded that our historical recurring losses from operations and net working capital deficit, as well as our dependence on private equity and other financings, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our auditor has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These adjustments would likely include substantial impairment of the carrying amount of our assets and potential contingent liabilities that may arise if we are unable to fulfill various operational commitments. In addition, the value of our securities, including Common Stock issued in this offering, would be greatly impaired. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow from operations and obtaining additional capital and financing, including funds to be raised in this offering. If our ability to generate cash flow from operations is delayed or reduced and we are unable to raise additional funding from other sources, we may be unable to continue in business even if this offering is successful.

Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Over the past four years, we have experienced rapid growth and we continue to rapidly and significantly expand our operations. While we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods, it is not indicative of our future revenue growth. We expect our revenue growth rate will decline. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, our revenue grew by 513% and 398%, respectively, as compared to revenue from the prior fiscal years. This dynamic growth increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results.

The growth and expansion of our business creates significant challenges for our management, operational and financial resources. In the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. As our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative solutions. This could negatively affect our business performance.
 
We expect to invest heavily in growing our business, which may cause our sales and marketing, research and development, and other cost centers to increase. Our historical rate of growth may not be sustainable or indicative of our future rate of growth. We believe that our continued growth in revenue, as well as our ability to improve or maintain margins and profitability, will depend upon, among other factors, our ability to address the challenges, risks, and difficulties described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and the extent to which our various offerings grow and contribute to our results of operations.

We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully manage any such challenges or risks to our future growth. In addition, our customer base may not continue to grow or may decline due to a variety of possible risks, including increased competition, changes in the regulatory landscape, and the maturation of our business. Any of these factors could cause our revenue growth to decline and may adversely affect our margins and profitability. Failure to continue our revenue growth or margin improvement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should not rely on our historical rate of revenue growth as an indication of our future performance

A significant barrier to online communications and commerce is the inability to ensure secure access or transmission of information over the Internet. Despite the implementation of security measures and the successful completion of security audits, iRemedy’s networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other disruptions. A wrongdoer who can circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our Internet operations. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage iRemedy’s reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability. We may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Additionally, as iRemedy increases its focus on ecommerce and g-commerce, our customers will become more concerned about security.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Between November 2020 and July 2022, we sourced and delivered a total of 541 million needles and syringes to a designated warehousing facility in Chicago, Illinois in support of the national vaccination program pursuant to a completed subcontracting agreement with a prime contractor. 56% of our total revenues in 2020 were generated from three customers; and 92% of our total revenues in 2021 were generated through two customers, including a prime contractor, Goldbelt Security, LLC (“Goldbelt”), to the U.S. government in support of its national COVID-19 vaccination program pursuant to a subcontractor agreement to supply needles and syringes to the U.S. government. In January of 2022, we received an award from the government, through our relationship with Goldbelt for $47 million in COVID test kits. If iRemedy is not successful at winning the new medical supply contract award from Countermeasures Acceleration Group, or CAG, then our operating and financial results could be adversely affected as 89% of our total revenues in 2021 were generated through the previously completed medical supply contract with Goldbelt.

The loss of one or more of these customers, failure to replace completed contracts with new contracts from these customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them (in the event that the COVID-19 health crisis is resolved and demand for medical supplies to treat or prevent the virus materially declines) would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
In October 2021, we successfully completed the subcontract agreement with a prime contractor, Goldbelt Security, LLC, to the U.S. government in support of its national COVID-19 vaccination program pursuant to a subcontractor agreement to supply needles and syringes to the U.S. government. In January of 2022, we received an award from the government, through our relationship with Goldbelt for $47 million in COVID test kits. There is no certainty that our Company will be awarded any additional contracts in association with the perpetuation of the COVID-19 vaccination program in the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Subcontracting with a prime contractor to the U.S. government is subject to special risks. For example:

 	●	Changes in government administration and national priorities, including developments in the geo-political environment, could have a significant impact on national spending priorities and the efficient handling of routine contractual matters. These changes could have a negative impact on our business in the future.

 	●	Contracts with prime contractors are subject to termination either upon default by the subcontractor or at the convenience of the contractor if, among other reasons, the program itself has been terminated. Termination for convenience provisions generally entitles the subcontractor to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination, but there can be no assurance in this regard.
 	 	 
 	●	Because we contract to supply goods and services to a U.S. government prime contractor, we compete for contracts in a competitive bidding process. We may compete directly with other suppliers or align with a prime or subcontractor competing for a contract. We may not be awarded the contract if the pricing or product offering is not competitive, either at our level or the prime or subcontractor level. In addition, in the event we are awarded a contract, we are subject to protests by losing bidders of contract awards that can result in the reopening of the bidding process and changes in governmental policies or regulations and other political factors. In addition, we may be subject to multiple rebid requirements over the life of a program in order to continue to participate in such program, which can result in the loss of the program or significantly reduce our revenue or margin from the program.
 	 	 
 	●	Consolidation among government contractors has resulted in a few large contractors with increased bargaining power relative to us. The increased bargaining power of these contractors may adversely affect our ability to compete for contracts and, as a result, may adversely affect our business or results of operations in the future.
 	 	 
 	●	The U.S. government prime contractor with whom we contracted with must comply with and is affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. A violation of these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties to the prime contractor or the termination of its contract with the U.S. government. As a result, there could be a delay in our receipt of orders from the prime contractor, a termination of such orders, or a termination of contract between the prime contractor and the U.S. government. Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.

We believe that a critical component to our success has been our corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. As we continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture, especially given that the majority of our workforce has traditionally worked remotely and we have been unable to hold in-person employee gatherings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth and organizational change, including growth and organizational change resulting from our acquisition of and subsequent integration with other businesses, which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new employees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in this way, without undermining our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.

In addition, to attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, highly competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize, and retain our employees. We face significant competition for talent from other healthcare, technology, and high-growth companies, which include both large enterprises and privately-held companies. We may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity, and retention could suffer, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The healthcare software and ecommerce markets are rapidly changing and intensely competitive and iRemedy expects that competition will continue to intensify.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
We may in the future consider opportunities to acquire or make additional investments in new or complementary businesses, technologies, offerings, tools or solutions, or enter into strategic alliances, that may enhance our capabilities and platform in general, complement our current offerings, or expand the breadth of our markets. Our ability to successfully grow through these types of strategic transactions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable target businesses, technologies, tools and solutions and to obtain any necessary financing, and is subject to numerous risks, including:

 	●	failure to identify acquisition, investment, or other strategic alliance opportunities that we deem suitable or available on favorable terms;

In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take impairment charges to our results of operations based on our impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.

We may experience challenges with managing our growth related to future acquisitions. The operation and integration of the acquired technologies and business operations may require substantial financial costs and management attention. If we fail to manage such integration processes in a timely and effective manner, our business and financial results may suffer. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisitions or strategic relationships, or if we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, technologies, tools, and solutions effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

<a class="js-risk_link c-link--no-underline offerings-show-risks_section__risk_link" href="javascript:void(0)">The COVID-19 pandemic and any other future pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.</a>
<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. Since then, SARS-CoV-2, and the resulting disease, COVID-19, has spread to almost every country in the world and all 50 states within the United States. Global health concerns relating to the outbreak of COVID-19 have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty. In addition, any industry connected to the delivery of health care services has been significantly impacted in the attempt to respond to the needs created by the outbreak. The duration and severity of this pandemic is unknown, and the extent of the business disruption and financial impact depend on factors beyond our knowledge and control.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, and partners. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the determination of appropriate measures and business practices has diverted management’s time and attention. A larger percentage of our employees are now working from home, and if they are not able to effectively do so, or if our employees contract COVID-19 or another contagious disease, we may experience a decrease in productivity and operational efficiency, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, because an increased number of employees are working remotely in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience an increased risk of security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions as a result of accessing sensitive information from multiple remote locations.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our customers have increased their purchases of personal protection equipment and other COVID-related products that we offer for sale. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and if these customers reduce medical supply spending related to COVID response, this could cause our growth to decline in future periods. Specifically, 56% of our total revenues in 2020 were generated from three customers; and 92% of our total revenues in 2021 were generated through two customers, including a prime-contractor of the U.S. government in support of its national COVID-19 vaccination program. Between November 2020 and December 31, 2021, we sourced and delivered a total of 541 million needles and syringes to a designated warehousing facility in Chicago, Illinois in support of the national vaccination program. In January of 2022, we received an award from the government, through our relationship with Goldbelt for $47 million in COVID test kits. If iRemedy is not successful at winning the new medical supply contract award from CAG, then our operating and financial results could be adversely affected as 89% of our total revenues in 2021 were generated through the previously completed medical supply contract with Goldbelt. In the event that the COVID-19 health crisis is resolved and demand for medical supplies to treat or prevent the virus materially declines, then our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.

COVID-19 pandemic-related market changes that have caused an increased demand in pandemic management solutions and other increases in health systems spending may cause us to invest in additional solutions and offerings to meet these needs and may also cause an increase in competitive offerings. If we are not able to make a return on those investments, meet the market demands, or effectively compete in the marketplace, our business results may suffer. Also, the financial impact of COVID-19 or another pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may lead to an overall decrease in healthcare spending due to a potential economic downturn and overall uncertainty causing healthcare expenditures to be concentrated in emergency care, which may cause a material impact to our business.

While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, including COVID-19, may be difficult to assess or predict, the widespread COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. The impact of any pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, including COVID-19, on the needs, expectations, and spending levels of our customers could impact our ability to maintain or grow our business and as a result our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.

The full extent to which the outbreak of COVID-19 will impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition is still unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the outbreak of COVID-19 has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of COVID-19” for additional information.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Future acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment, in part or in full, for the business or assets acquired. Any future issuances of equity securities would further dilute our existing shareholders’ ownership interests. Future acquisitions may also decrease our future earnings or earnings per share and the benefits derived by us from an acquisition might not outweigh or might not exceed the dilutive effect of the acquisition. We also may incur additional indebtedness, have future impairment of assets, or suffer adverse tax and accounting consequences in connection with any future acquisitions. Furthermore, operating decisions may impact existing products and platforms. If any of these decisions are expected to potentially result in the limitation or discontinuation of use of certain assets, we would expect accelerated depreciation and potential impairment of assets including property and equipment, software and website development costs, intangible assets or goodwill.

If we are not successful in completing acquisitions in the future, we may be required to reevaluate our acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash to pay all or a portion of the purchase prices of future acquisitions. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts, others may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.

In the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or technology partnerships to develop proposed solutions and to pursue new markets. Proposing, negotiating, and implementing collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology, or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. We may not identify, secure or complete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. We have limited institutional knowledge and experience with respect to these business development activities, and we may also not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction or arrangement. In particular, these collaborations may not result in the development of solutions that achieve commercial success or result in significant revenue and could be terminated prior to developing any solutions.

Additionally, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the transaction or arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our collaborators may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals. It is possible that conflicts may arise with our collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration.

If any conflicts arise with our current or future collaborators, they may act in their self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interest, and they may breach their obligations to us. In addition, we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our current collaborators or any future collaborators devote to our collaborators’ or our future solutions. Disputes between us and our collaborators may result in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management. Further, these transactions and arrangements are contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the applicable agreements and, in such event, we may not continue to have rights to the products relating to such transaction or arrangement or may need to purchase such rights at a premium.

 	●	make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the senior secured credit facility and the senior subordinated note;
 	 	 
 	●	make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;
 	 	 
 	●	require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
 	 	 
 	●	limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

U.S. and foreign laws relating to ecommerce or Internet communications are becoming more prevalent.

If iRemedy were alleged to violate federal, state or foreign civil or criminal laws, even if these claims could be successfully defended, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Given that laws and government regulations are complex, vary widely from state to state, and are frequently changed, iRemedy’s products and services may not be legal or practical in all jurisdictions. For example, iRemedy may not be able to ensure that its products and services keep pace with these frequently changing regulations and could be subject to liability. Such liability may place our activities under increased regulation, increase our cost of doing business and thereby decrease the demand for our products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on iRemedy’s business, its results of operations and its financial condition.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and our key metrics require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and amounts reported in our key metrics. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to the determination of fair value of equity-based compensation, equity-linked financial instruments, inventory obsolescence, useful life of intangible assets, right-of-use assets and liabilities and utilization of deferred tax assets.

If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our business could be impaired, and our operating results could suffer. Even if we are successful, these relationships may not result in improved operating results.

We have been subject to litigation in the past and may become subject to litigation in the future. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which we are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to defend ourselves vigorously; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments, and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and per share trading price of our Common Stock. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers.

Currently, the acquisition and maintenance of domain names is regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain names in the U.S. is controlled by a non-profit corporation. The creation of additional top-level domains will likely take place sometime in the near future. Requirements for holding domain names may also be affected. We cannot assure that we will be able to acquire or maintain relevant domain names. In addition, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear.

iRemedy believes its success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of key personnel. The loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on iRemedy Healthcare. iRemedy Healthcare’s operations will also depend to a great extent on its ability to attract new key personnel with Internet experience and retain existing key personnel in the future. iRemedy Healthcare’s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales, technical and management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that iRemedy Healthcare can retain key sales and management employees or that it can attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified sales, technical and management personnel in the future. There can be no assurance that iRemedy Healthcare will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for growth.

While iRemedy Healthcare depends on certain key personnel, the Company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to those individuals in the event of their death or disability. Therefore, should any of these key personnel, management or founders die or become disabled, the Company will not receive compensation that would assist with such person’s absence. The loss of such person could negatively affect the Company and its operations.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Companies in the Internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed, misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights. To the extent we gain greater public recognition, we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Third parties may have intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters. In addition, some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. In a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid, or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents, and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights. Moreover, our patents may provide little or no deterrence in litigation involving patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third-party’s rights in jurisdictions where we do business. We also might be required to enter into costly settlement agreements or seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business.

The software and code underlying our technology platform is highly interconnected and complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. We typically release software code daily and this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform, which can impact the user and merchant experience on our platform. Additionally, due to the interconnected nature of the software underlying our platform, updates to certain parts of our code, including changes to our website or mobile app or third-party APIs on which our website and mobile app rely, could have an unintended impact on other sections of our code, which may result in errors or vulnerabilities to our platform. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of our merchants or users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business. Our business operations and future growth are dependent on the ability of our proprietary software systems to rapidly build and manage out catalog, execute sales and fulfill orders through our automated systems.

We use open source software in our proprietary software and systems and will use open source software in the future. The licenses applicable to our use of open source software may require that source code that is developed using open source software be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to certain open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights or demanding the release or license of the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly release the affected portions of our source code, be limited in or cease using the implicated software unless and until we can re-engineer such software to avoid infringement or change the use of, or remove, the implicated open source software. Our use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our website and systems that rely on open source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
We rely heavily on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, including our technology platform, and to maintain our competitive position. With respect to our technology platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be one of our primary sources of intellectual property. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology in part by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside contractors, consultants, advisors, and other third parties.

We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses containing invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with employees or third parties. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary information, including our technology and processes. Despite these efforts, no assurance can be given that the confidentiality agreements we enter into will be effective in controlling access to such proprietary information and trade secrets. The confidentiality agreements on which we rely to protect certain technologies may be breached, may not be adequate to protect our confidential information, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, trade secrets, or proprietary technology. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors or others from independently developing the same or similar technologies and processes, which may allow them to provide a service similar or superior to ours, which could harm our competitive position.

Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, it could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Section 21 of our certificate of incorporation and Section 7.4 of our bylaws provides that “[u]nless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or federal court located in the county in which the principal office of the corporation in the State of Delaware is established, in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange of 1934, as amended, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any claim for which the federal courts have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction.” Therefore, the exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws will not relieve us of our duty to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.

This exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us or our directors, officers or other employees. In addition, shareholders who do bring a claim in the state or federal court in the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The state or federal court of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a shareholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our shareholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation have been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.

Section 7.4 of our bylaws provides that “[i]f any action is brought by any party against another party, relating to or arising out of these Bylaws, or the enforcement hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense of such action, provided that the provisions of this sentence shall not apply with respect to “internal corporate claims” as defined in Section 109(b) of the DGCL.”

Our bylaws provide that for this section, the term “attorneys’ fees” or “attorneys’ fees and costs” means the fees and expenses of counsel to the Company and any other parties asserting a claim subject to Section 7.4 of the bylaws, which may include printing, photocopying, duplicating and other expenses, air freight charges, and fees billed for law clerks, paralegals and other persons not admitted to the bar but performing services under the supervision of an attorney, and the costs and fees incurred in connection with the enforcement or collection of any judgment obtained in any such proceeding. 

We adopted the fee-shifting provision to eliminate or decrease nuisance and frivolous litigation. We intend to apply the fee-shifting provision broadly to all actions except for claims brought under the Exchange Act and Securities Act.

There is no set level of recovery required to be met by a plaintiff to avoid payment under this provision. Instead, whoever is the prevailing party is entitled to recover the reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense of such action. Any party who brings an action, and the party against whom such action is brought under Section 7.4 of our bylaws, which could include, but is not limited to former and current shareholders, Company directors, officers, affiliates, legal counsel, expert witnesses and other parties, are subject to this provision. Additionally, any party who brings an action, and the party against whom such action is brought under Section 7.4 of our bylaws, which could include, but is not limited to former and current shareholders, Company directors, officers, affiliates, legal counsel, expert witnesses and other parties, would be able to recover fees under this provision.

In the event you initiate or assert a claim against us, in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions contained in our Bylaws, and you do not, in a judgment prevail, you will be obligated to reimburse us for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses and costs of appeal, if any.

Upon the completion of this Offering, we expect to become an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These provisions include, but are not limited to: being permitted to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosures; being exempt from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; being subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and not being required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or on any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

In addition, while we are an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to comply with any new financial accounting standard until such standard is generally applicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that are not “emerging growth companies” or elect not to avail themselves of this provision.

We may remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as December 31, 2027, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this initial public offering, though we may cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier under certain circumstances, including if (i) we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (ii) we become a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year, or (iii) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

The exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our Common Stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.

In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

In the event that our shares are traded, and our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a “penny stock”, which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a “penny stock”. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the “penny stock” rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
FINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Each state has its own securities laws, often called “blue sky” laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state.

We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. We have not yet applied to have our securities registered in any state and will not do so until we receive expressions of interest from investors resident in specific states after they have viewed this prospectus. We will initially focus our offering in the state of Texas and will rely on exemptions found in the Texas Securities Act. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Our Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, and are being offered in reliance upon the exemption provided by Section 3(b) of the Securities Act and Regulation A promulgated thereunder. We represent that this Offering Circular does not contain any untrue statements of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of all the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. However, if this representation is inaccurate with respect to a material fact, if this offering fails to qualify for exemption from registration under the federal securities laws pursuant to Regulation A, or if we fail to register the Shares or find an exemption under the securities laws of each state in which we offer the Shares, each investor may have the right to rescind his, her or its purchase of the Shares and to receive back from the Company his, her or its purchase price with interest. Such investors, however, may be unable to collect on any judgment, and the cost of obtaining such judgment may outweigh the benefits. If investors successfully seek rescission, we would face severe financial demands we may not be able to meet and it may adversely affect any non-rescinding investors.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The initial public offering price per share will be substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock outstanding prior to this offering. As a result, investors purchasing Common Stock in this offering will experience immediate dilution of $(8.84) per share. This dilution is due in large part to the fact that our earlier investors paid substantially less than the initial public offering price when they purchased their shares of Common Stock. In addition, if we issue additional equity securities, you will experience additional dilution.

In considering an investment in the Company of a portion of the assets of a trust or a pension or profit-sharing plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and exempt from tax under Section 501(a), a fiduciary should consider (i) whether the investment satisfies the diversification requirements of Section 404 of ERISA; (ii) whether the investment is prudent, since the Offered Shares are not freely transferable and there may not be a market created in which the Offered Shares may be sold or otherwise disposed; and (iii) whether interests in the Company or the underlying assets owned by the Company constitute “Plan Assets” under ERISA.

The principal purposes of this offering are to raise additional capital, to create a public market for our Common Stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the proceeds we receive from this offering after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and expenses associated with qualification of Offering under Regulation A, including legal, auditing, accounting, transfer agent, financial printer and other professional fees as well as the one time set up fee payable to Dalmore, primarily for (a) the implementation of our business plan, including but not limited to, (i) funding the acquisition or investment complementary businesses, products, services, technologies or other assets, (ii) funding growth strategies which are discussed in this Offering Circular and (iii) working capital and general corporate purposes. Our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. Investors in this offering will need to rely upon the judgment of our management with respect to the use of proceeds. If we do not use the net proceeds that we receive in this offering effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed, and the market price of our Common Stock could decline.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:

 	●	no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;
 	 	 
 	●	the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
 	 	 
 	●	the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;
 	 	 
 	●	limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;
 	 	 
 	●	providing that a special meeting of the stockholders may only be called by a majority of the board of directors;
 	 	 
 	●	providing that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote; and
 	 	 
 	●	advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.

These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our board of directors and management.

Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our security holders to receive a premium for their securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our securities.

The process of designing and implementing internal controls over financial reporting is time consuming, costly, and complicated. If during the evaluation and testing process, we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or determine that existing material weaknesses have not been remediated, our management will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented, or reviewed. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the valuation of our Common Stock could be adversely affected.

The Board of Directors of iRemedy has the power to establish the dividend rates, liquidation preferences, voting rights, redemption and conversion terms, and all other rights, preferences and privileges with respect to any series of preferred stock. The issuance of any series of preferred stock having rights superior to those of iRemedy’s Common Stock may result in a decrease in the value or market price of our Common Stock and could be used by iRemedy’s Board of Directors as a means to prevent a change in control of our Company.

Future issuances of preferred stock may provide for dividends and certain preferences in liquidation, as well as conversion rights. Such preferred stock issuances could make the possible takeover of iRemedy, or the removal of management of iRemedy, more difficult. The issuance of such preferred stock could discourage hostile bids for control of iRemedy in which stockholders could receive premiums for their Common Stock, could adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of iRemedy’s Common Stock, or could depress the market price of the iRemedy Common Stock.
