<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Because it has not made a significant equity investment in our Company, the Manager will have little exposure to loss in the value of the interests. Without this exposure, our investors may be at a greater risk of loss because the Manager does not have as much to lose from a decrease in the value of our interests as do those Managers who make more significant equity investments in their companies.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
As a Tier 2 issuer, we are subject to scaled disclosure and reporting requirements which may make an investment in our interests less attractive to investors who are accustomed to enhanced disclosure and more frequent financial reporting. The differences between disclosures for Tier 2 issuers versus those for emerging growth companies selling their securities in registered public offerings include, without limitation, only needing to file final semiannual reports as opposed to quarterly reports and far fewer circumstances where a current disclosure would be required. In addition, given the relative lack of regulatory precedent regarding the recent amendments to Regulation A, there is some regulatory uncertainty in regard to how the Commission or the individual state securities regulators will regulate both the offer and sale of our securities, as well as any ongoing compliance that we may be subject to. For example, a number of states have yet to determine the types of filings and amount of fees that are required for such an offering. If our scaled disclosure and reporting requirements, or regulatory uncertainty regarding Regulation A, reduces the attractiveness of the interests, we may be unable to raise the funds necessary to fund future offerings, which could impair our ability to offer a diversified portfolio of properties and create economies of scale, which may adversely affect the value of the interests or the ability to make distributions to investors.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
As a Tier 2 issuer, we will not need to provide a report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, and we will be exempt from the auditor attestation requirements concerning any such report so long as we are a Tier 2 issuer. We are in the process of evaluating whether our internal control procedures are effective and therefore there is a greater likelihood of undiscovered errors in our internal controls or reported financial statements as compared to issuers that have conducted such evaluations.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The Exchange Act requires issuers with more than $10 million in total assets to register its equity securities under the Exchange Act if its securities are held of record by more than 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not “accredited investors.” While the Operating Agreement presently prohibits any transfer that would result in any series being held of record by more than 2,000 persons or 500 non-”accredited investors,” there can be no guarantee that we will not exceed those limits and the Manager has the ability to unilaterally amend the Operating Agreement to permit holdings that exceed those limits. A series may have more than 2,000 total interests, which would make it more likely that there accidentally would be greater than 2,000 beneficial owners of or 500 non- “accredited investors” in that series. If we are required to register under the Exchange Act, it would result in significant expense and reporting requirements that would place a burden on the Manager and may divert attention from management of the properties by the Manager or could cause the Manager to no longer be able to afford to run our business.

The Manager will utilize the Manager’s personnel to perform services on its behalf for us. Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions to our investors is dependent upon the performance of the Manager and its affiliates as well as the Manager’s real estate professionals in the identification and acquisition of investments, the management of our assets and operation of our day-to-day activities. Any adverse changes in the Manager’s financial condition or our relationship with the Manager could hinder the Manager’s ability to successfully manage our operations and our properties.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The Company is not registered and will not be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), and the Manager is not and will not be registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”) and the interests do not have the benefit of the protections of the Investment Company Act or the Investment Advisers Act. The Company and the Manager have taken the position that the properties are not “securities” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act or the Investment Advisers Act, and, thus, the Company’s assets will consist of less than 40% investment securities under the Investment Company Act and the Manager is not and will not be advising with respect to securities under the Investment Advisers Act. This position, however, is based on applicable case law that is inherently subject to judgments and interpretation. If the Company were to be required to register under the Investment Company Act or the Manager were to be required to register under the Investment Advisers Act, it could have a material and adverse impact on the results of operations and expenses of each series and the Manager might be forced to liquidate and wind up each operating series, rescind the offerings for any of the series with ongoing offerings or discontinue plans for future offerings for any additional series.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, is subject to change by Congress, and interpretations of the Code may be modified or affected by judicial decisions, by the Treasury Department through changes in regulations and by the Internal Revenue Service through its audit policy, announcements, and published and private rulings. Although significant changes to the tax laws historically have been given prospective application, no assurance can be given that any changes made in the tax law affecting an investment in any series of the Company would be limited to prospective effect. For instance, prior to effectiveness of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, an exchange of the interests of one series for another might have been a non-taxable ‘like-kind exchange’ transaction, while transactions now only qualify for that treatment with respect to real property. Accordingly, the ultimate effect on an investor’s tax situation may be governed by laws, regulations or interpretations of laws or regulations which have not yet been proposed, passed or made, as the case may be.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Both we and the Manager are newly formed companies and have limited operating history. You should consider an investment in our interests in light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by other newly formed companies with similar objectives. To be successful in this market, we and the Manager must, among other things:
 
 	●	identify and acquire real estate assets consistent with our investment strategies;
 	●	increase awareness of our name within the investment products market;
 	●	attract, integrate, motivate and retain qualified personnel to manage our day-to-day operations; and
 	●	build and expand our operations structure to support our business.

We have minimal operating capital and for the foreseeable future will be dependent upon our ability to finance our operations from the sale of equity or other financing alternatives. The failure to successfully raise operating capital could result in our bankruptcy or other event which would have a material adverse effect on us and our investors. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our investment objectives.

<a class="js-risk_link c-link--no-underline offerings-show-risks_section__risk_link" href="javascript:void(0)">An investment in a series constitutes only an investment in the series and not in the Company, any other series or directly in any property owned by the series.</a>
<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
An investor in a series will acquire an ownership interest only in the series and not, for the avoidance of doubt, in (i) the Company, (ii) any other series or (iii) directly in the properties owned the series or the properties owned by any other series. The voting rights of the investor are solely related to the series and are limited by the Operating Agreement. Investors will have voting rights only with respect to certain matters primarily relating to amendments to the Operating Agreement that would adversely change the rights of the investor and the removal of the Manager for cause. The Manager thus retains significant control over the management of the Company, the series and the properties. Furthermore, because the interests do not constitute an investment in the Company as a whole, investors are not expected to receive any economic benefit from, or be subject to the liabilities of, the assets of any other series. In addition, the economic interest of an investor will not be identical to owning a direct undivided interest in a property owned by the series.

We intend for a series to form a subsidiary to make investments and, through such subsidiary, to own and operate our Real Property Investments (as defined below). The return of a series will depend on the revenues generated by its properties and the appreciation of the value of those properties over time. This, in turn, depends on factors as the expertise of the Manager, national and local economic cycles and conditions, financial markets and the economy, competition from existing properties as well as future properties and government regulation (such as tax and building code charges). The value of a property may decline substantially after a series purchases its interest in it.

There is currently no public trading market for the interests and an active market may not develop or be sustained. If an active public trading market for the interests does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult or impossible for you to resell your interests at any price. Even if a resale market does develop, the market price could decline below the amount you paid for your interests. The Manager is not obligated to develop a resale market for the interests and does not currently intend to do so. Investors should consider the resale market for the interests to be limited.

We intend to diversify our cash and cash equivalents among several banking institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.

We expect to have cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured levels. If any of the banking institutions in which we have deposited funds ultimately fails, we may lose our deposits over $250,000.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Each state has its own securities laws, often called “blue sky” laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers and stockbrokers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. Also, Dalmore or OpenDeal, as the case may be, must be registered in that state. We do not know whether our securities will be registered, or exempt, under the laws of any states. A determination regarding registration will be made by broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as the market-makers for our interests. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our interests. Investors should consider the resale market for our securities to be limited. Investors may be unable to resell their securities, or they may be unable to resell them without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.

Due to the start-up nature of the Company and the Manager, there can be no guarantee that the Company will reach its funding target for a series. If fewer interests are sold, investors will be responsible for paying proportionately larger shares of Operating Expenses and proportionately less capital will be available to the series for investment. This will limit the ability of the series to acquire more interests and potentially achieve higher returns for investors.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Factors that may adversely affect our ability to control the Operating Expenses of our properties include the need to pay for insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, which could increase over time, the need periodically to repair, renovate and re-lease a property, the cost of compliance with governmental regulation, including zoning, environmental and tax laws, the potential for liability under applicable laws, interest rate levels, principal loan amounts and the availability of financing. If our Operating Expenses increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

The expense of owning and operating a property is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from a property. As a result, if revenues decline, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly. Costs associated with real estate investments, such as real estate taxes, insurance, loan payments and maintenance, generally will not be reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. If we are unable to decrease operating costs when demand for our properties decreases and our revenues decline, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our investors may be adversely affected.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The real estate market is highly competitive. We will compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and purchasers for our series investments. These competitors will include REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels as those used by our Company and the series. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we may pursue and adversely affect our profitability and impede our growth.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The leasing of residential real estate is highly competitive. We will compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of a property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which a property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties. If other lessors and developers of similar spaces in our markets offer leases at prices comparable to or less than the prices we offer on the properties we acquire, we may be unable to attract or retain tenants or re-lease our properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business could be harmed by an economic slowdown and downturn in real estate asset values. Periods of economic slowdown or recession, significantly rising interest rates, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for real estate, declining real estate values, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may result in a general decline in acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents, which in turn would reduce the value of our interests.

During an economic downturn, it may also take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or the selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated. As a result, the carrying value of our real estate investments may become impaired and we could record losses as a result of such impairment or we could experience reduced profitability related to declines in real estate values or rents. Further, as a result of our target leverage, our exposure to adverse general economic conditions will be heightened.

All the conditions described above could adversely impact our business performance and profitability, which could result in our failure to make distributions to our investors and could decrease the value of an investment in us. In addition, in an extreme deterioration of our business, we could have insufficient liquidity to meet our debt service obligations when they come due in future years. If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under secured loans, the lenders will be entitled to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt owed.

Residential rental properties are subject to various covenants, local laws and regulatory requirements, including permitting and licensing requirements. Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, may restrict our use of our residential properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our residential properties, including prior to acquiring any of our residential properties or when undertaking renovations. Among other things, these restrictions may relate to fire and safety, seismic, asbestos-cleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements. We cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations, or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs. Our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits, licenses and zoning approvals. Our failure to obtain such permits, licenses and zoning approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our interests to decline.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The Company is structured as a Delaware series limited liability company that issues interests in a separate series for each city in which it intends to invest. Each series will merely be a separate series and not a separate legal entity. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, or the LLC Act, if certain conditions (as set forth in Section 18-215(b) of the LLC Act) are met, the liability of investors holding interests in one series is segregated from the liability of investors holding interests in another series and the assets of one series are not available to satisfy the liabilities of other series. Although this limitation of liability is recognized by the courts of Delaware, there is no guarantee that if challenged in the courts of another U.S. State or a foreign jurisdiction, such courts will uphold a similar interpretation of Delaware corporation law. If the Company’s series limited liability company structure is not respected, then investors in a series may have to share any liabilities of the Company with investors in all other series and not just those who hold the same series as them. Furthermore, while we intend to maintain separate and distinct records for each series and account for them separately and otherwise meet the requirements of the LLC Act, it is possible a court could conclude that the methods used did not satisfy Section 18-215(b) of the LLC Act and thus potentially expose the assets of a series to the liabilities of another series. The consequence of this is that investors may have to bear higher than anticipated expenses which would adversely affect the value of their interests or the likelihood of any distributions being made by a series to investors. In addition, we are not aware of any court case that has tested the limitations on inter-series liability provided by Section 18-215(b) in federal bankruptcy courts and it is possible that a bankruptcy court could determine that the assets of one series should be applied to meet the liabilities of the other series or the liabilities of the Company generally where the assets of such other series or of the Company generally are insufficient to meet our liabilities.

Our real estate assets will be subject to the risks typically associated with real estate. The value of real estate may be adversely affected by a number of risks, including:

 	●	natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods;
 	 	 
 	●	acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of terrorist attacks;
 	 	 
 	●	adverse changes in national and local economic and real estate conditions;
 	 	 
 	●	an oversupply of (or a reduction in demand for) space in the areas where particular properties are located and the attractiveness of particular properties to prospective tenants;
 	 	 
 	●	changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance therewith and the potential for liability under applicable laws;
 	 	 
 	●	costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions affecting properties; and
 	 	 
 	●	the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses.

The value of each property is affected significantly by its ability to generate cash flow and net income, which in turn depends on the amount of rental or other income that can be generated net of expenses required to be incurred with respect to a property. Many expenditures associated with a property (such as operating expenses and capital expenditures) cannot be reduced when there is a reduction in income from the property.

These factors may have a material adverse effect on the value that we can realize from our assets.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant’s lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy code. A bankruptcy filing by one of our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant’s lease obligations would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court. There is no assurance the tenant or its trustee would agree to assume the lease. If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages that is limited in amount and which may only be paid to the extent that funds are available and in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.

A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums. A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments that would mean a reduction in our cash flow and the amount available to pay distributions to our investors.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments) for the purpose of making investments. In such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the joint venture. Investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their required capital contributions. Co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the co-venturer would have full control over the joint venture. In addition, to the extent our participation represents a minority interest, a majority of the participants may be able to take actions which are not in our best interests because of our lack of full control. Disputes between us and co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our co-venturers.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which may tend to limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of assets in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions. Our inability to sell our properties on favorable terms or at all could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. In addition, real estate can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable. When we sell any of our assets, we may recognize a loss on such sale.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
There are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks associated with such catastrophic events could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.

This risk is particularly relevant with respect to potential acts of terrorism. The TRIA, under which the U.S. federal government bore a significant portion of insured losses caused by terrorism, will expire on December 31, 2020, and there can be no assurance that Congress will act to renew or replace the TRIA following its expiration. If the TRIA is not renewed or replaced, terrorism insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain at reasonable costs or at all, which may result in adverse impacts and additional costs to us.

Changes in the cost or availability of insurance due to the non-renewal of the TRIA or for other reasons could expose us to uninsured casualty losses. If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss, which may reduce the value of our investors’ investments. In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property. Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in lower distributions to investors.

Additionally, mortgage lenders insist in some cases that multifamily property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans. Accordingly, to the extent terrorism risk insurance policies are not available at reasonable costs, if at all, our ability to finance or refinance our properties could be impaired. In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, labeled COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. This virus, declared a pandemic by the World health Organization, has spread throughout the world and to every state in the United States. Although mitigation efforts including vaccination programs have begun to have an impact on reducing the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus is still expected to have a negative impact on economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere.

Although we are just beginning our operations and the coronavirus has not yet impacted our business, we expect that, like most businesses world-wide, the coronavirus pandemic will impact us in ways that may be material. It may affect the ability of our series to successfully conduct their securities offerings and acquire their series properties, prospective tenants in their ability to lease and pay rent on our series properties, our Manager to successfully manage our operations and the future value of any series properties that we may acquire.

From time to time, we may attempt to acquire multiple properties in a single transaction. Multiple property portfolio acquisitions are more complex and expensive than single-property acquisitions, and the risk that a portfolio acquisition does not close may be greater than in a single-property acquisition. A seller may require that a group of properties be purchased as a package even though we may not want to purchase one or more properties in the portfolio. In these situations, if we are unable to identify another person or entity to acquire the unwanted properties, we may be required to operate or attempt to dispose of these properties. To acquire multiple properties in a single transaction we may be required to accumulate a large amount of cash. We would expect the returns that we earn on such cash to be less than the ultimate returns in real property and therefore, accumulating such cash could reduce the funds available for distributions to our investors.

As landlord of numerous residential properties, we may be involved in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease. Eviction activities will impose legal and managerial expenses that will raise our costs. The eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers, mandatory “cure” policies and other sources of expense and delay, each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the home. Additionally, state and local landlord-tenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord’s ability to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage that residents cause to the landlord’s premises. We and any property managers we hire will need to be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlord-tenant laws, and we will need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance. To the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws, we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals, in class actions or by state or local law enforcement.

If a builder fails to perform, we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance. A builder’s performance may also be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder’s control. Delays in completing construction could also give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases. We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction. These and other factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment. In addition, we will be subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and human health. We could be subject to substantial liability in the form of fines, penalties or damages for noncompliance with these laws and regulations. Even if we are not subject to liability, other costs, which we would undertake to avoid or mitigate any such liability, such as the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances could be substantial. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the remediation of contamination associated with the release or disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the presence of toxic building materials and other health and safety-related concerns.

Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on the tenants, owners or operators of real property for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault, whether the contamination occurred prior to purchase, or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. Activities of our tenants, the condition of properties at the time we buy them, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties.

The presence of hazardous substances, including hazardous substances that have not been detected, or the failure to properly manage or remediate these substances, may hinder our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings. Any material expenditures, fines, penalties or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to make distributions to our investors and may reduce the value of your investment.

Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The costs of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our investors.

The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts available for distribution to our investors. We may be subject to all the risks described here even if we do not know about the hazardous materials and if the previous owners did not know about the hazardous materials on the property.

In addition, when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our projects could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property or development project, which would adversely affect our operating results.

Environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us or our property manager and its assignees from operating such properties. Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require us to incur material expenditures.

Some of the assets we invest in may be classified for accounting purposes as “available-for-sale.” These investments will be carried at estimated fair value and temporary changes in the market values of those assets will be directly charged or credited to investors’ equity without impacting net income on the income statement. Moreover, if we determine that a decline in the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale asset falls below its amortized value and is not temporary, we will recognize a loss on that asset on the income statement, which will reduce our earnings in the period recognized.
 
A decline in the market value of the assets we invest in may adversely affect us particularly in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets. If the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to support the loan. If we were unable to post the additional collateral, we may have to sell assets at a time when we might not otherwise choose to do so. A reduction in credit available may reduce our earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our investors.

Further, credit facility providers may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash reserves or to set aside unlevered assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position, which would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. As a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on equity. If we are unable to meet these contractual obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly.

Market values of our investments may decline for a number of reasons, such as changes in prevailing market rates, increases in defaults, increases in voluntary prepayments for those investments that we have that are subject to prepayment risk, widening of credit spreads and downgrades of ratings of the securities by ratings agencies.

<a class="js-risk_link c-link--no-underline offerings-show-risks_section__risk_link" href="javascript:void(0)">Any dispute in relation to the Operating Agreement is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, except where Federal law requires that certain claims be brought in Federal courts. The Operating Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, provides for investors to waive their right to a jury trial.</a>
<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Each investor will covenant and agree not to bring any claim in any venue other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if required, a federal court of the United States. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and investors will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

If an interest holder were to bring a claim against the Company or the Manager pursuant to the Operating Agreement and such claim was governed by state law, it would have to bring such claim in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Operating Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and subject to limited exceptions, provides for investors to consent to exclusive jurisdiction to Delaware Court of Chancery and for a waiver of the right to a trial by jury, if such waiver is allowed by the court where the claim is brought.

If we opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver, the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with the applicable state and federal law. To our knowledge, the enforceability of a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the United States Supreme Court. However, we believe that a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally enforceable, including under the laws of the Delaware, which govern the Operating Agreement, by a federal or state court in the State of Delaware, which has exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the Operating Agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision, courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial.

We believe that this is the case with respect to the Operating Agreement and our interests. It is advisable that you consult legal counsel regarding the jury waiver provision before entering into the Operating Agreement. Nevertheless, if this jury trial waiver provision is not permitted by applicable law, an action could proceed under the terms of the Operating Agreement with a jury trial. No condition, stipulation or provision of the Operating Agreement or our interests serves as a waiver by any investor or beneficial owner of our interests or by us of compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Additionally, the Company does not believe that claims under the federal securities laws shall be subject to the jury trial waiver provision, and the Company believes that the provision does not impact the rights of any investor or beneficial owner of our interests to bring claims under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

These provisions may have the effect of limiting the ability of investors to bring a legal claim against us due to geographic limitations and may limit an investor’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us. Furthermore, waiver of a trial by jury may disadvantage an investor to the extent a judge might be less likely than a jury to resolve an action in the investor’s favor. Further, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, an action or proceeding against us, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving these matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
While the initial sales of series interests are exempt from state securities registration requirements under Regulation A, that exemption does not apply to resales of the series interests to other investors by purchasers of the series interests. Each state has its own securities laws, often called “blue sky” laws. These laws limit resales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration; these laws also govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. The fact that the initial offering and sale of series interests qualifies for an exemption is not relevant to determining whether there is an exemption in a given state to allow a holder to resell the series interests to a resident of a given state. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on your ability to sell, and on purchasers to buy, your series interests.

Given the limited liquidity for the series interests, investors and potential investors may consider these investments to be less appealing and demand for these investments may decrease, which may adversely affect prices you may obtain on the Secondary Trading Platform or your ability to resell your series interests on the Secondary Trading Platform at all.

You should consider the resale market for our securities to be limited. You may be unable to resell your series interests, or you may be unable to resell them without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.

You should be prepared to hold the series interests indefinitely.</a>
<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
The series interests will not be listed on any securities exchange such as the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange. The series interests will generally not be transferable except through the Secondary Trading Platform, to the extent such platform is established and maintained.

We expect that after a series’ offering has concluded, the Secondary Trading Platform will be a venue available for the resale of such series’ interests through the broker-dealer, Dalmore, as a broker-dealer member of the Secondary Trading Platform; provided, however, that any such resale of a series’ interests will be subject to federal and state securities laws and the restrictions in the Operating Agreement, and there can be no assurance that an active market for any series interests will develop on the Secondary Trading Platform, that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available to allow resales of series interests to residents of all states, or that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available at all. For these reasons, investors must be prepared to hold their series interests indefinitely. As a result, you may lose some or all of your investment. See “Plan of Distribution- Transferability of the Interests.”

<a class="js-risk_link c-link--no-underline offerings-show-risks_section__risk_link" href="javascript:void(0)">The trading price of the series interests that trade on the Secondary Trading Platform may be extremely volatile.</a>
<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Securities that trade on the Secondary Trading Platform, as with other public markets, likely will experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations can be more pronounced for securities that have a small public float, such as the series interests may have. Series interest prices on the Secondary Trading Platform could fluctuate widely in response to various potential factors, many of which will be beyond our control, including the total number of available buyers or sellers at any point in time, property value, appraisals of the applicable property, occupancy rates, and economic, market, geopolitical and other external factors. As a result, the market prices of the series interests that may be listed on the Secondary Trading Platform may be volatile, and holders of such series interests may experience a decrease in the value of their interests. No assurance can be given that the market price of the series interests will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future or that you will be able to sell your series interests when desired on favorable terms or at all.

While we expect the Secondary Trading Platform will be available after the conclusion of a series offering, resale of a series’ interests on the Secondary Trading Platform will be subject to federal and state securities laws and the transfer restrictions set forth in the Operating Agreement, and there can be no assurance that an active market for any series interests will develop on the Secondary Trading Platform, that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available to allow resales of series interests to residents of all states, or that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available at all. For these reasons, investors must be prepared to hold their series interests indefinitely. See “Plan of Distribution – Transferability of the Interests.”

Because of the illiquid nature of the series’ interests, you should purchase the interests only as a long-term investment and be prepared to hold them for an indefinite period of time.

<div class='s-fontSize16 u-fontWeight400 js-risk_text offerings-show-risks_section__risk_text'>
Our web and mobile app-based investment platform, the Nada App, and the PPEX ATS are complex systems composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on the Nada App and the PPEX ATS. Our software, including opensource software that is incorporated into our code, and the software supporting the PPEX ATS, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including opensource software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to Nada App users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in Nada App unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on the Nada App due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”) data centers for the operation of the Nada App. If the AWS data centers fail, Nada App users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of the Nada App to users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of the Nada App. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of the Nada App or a negative experience for users and investors and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. The PPEX ATS faces risks similar to those described above.
