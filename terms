You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any).</p><p id="itceh4"><u class="u-fontWeight500">Informal Negotiations.</u> To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms (&quot;Dispute&quot;), you and the Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.

The arbitrator(s) shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific performance.

Waiver/Severability</h3><p id="igv71c">The failure of the Company to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of the Terms or to exercise any right thereunder shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company&#039;s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. In fact, the Company may choose to enforce certain portions of the Terms more strictly or to interpret certain provisions more strictly against certain users than it does against users in general, and such disparate treatment shall not be grounds for failing to comply with the Terms as so interpreted.</p><p id="i1jgft">You and the Company agree that if any portion of the Terms are found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p><h3 id="iqnfhj" class="s-fontSize20 u-fontWeight500">h.

Voucher System</h3><p id="iayzvi">Republic provides single-use bonus-codes (“Promotion Code”) to Investors on the Portal from time to time. The Promotion Code can only be applied toward investment commitments (“Investment Commitments”) for an Offering hosted by the Portal. The following describes the terms and conditions of the Promotion Code program (“Promotion Code Program”).</p><p id="ij0wbj">The ability of an Investor to invest in an Offering on the Portal will depend on the investor’s financial circumstances and investment history, pursuant to the eligibility requirements of Regulation CF of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Reg. CF”). To use the Promotion Code an Investor must have an Investor account on the Portal. To open an Investor account, a person has to provide certain information including contact information and representations regarding their income and net worth and certain aspects of their investment history.</p><p id="i1cgrj">Each Promotion Code (i) has an expiration date associated with the unique Promotion Code (the “Term” — investors can check expiration dates <a href="https://republic.com/check-promo-code" id="i0b8tw">here</a> ), (ii) cannot be transferred in any way (iii) is not reusable, and (iv) and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law). An Investor may only use one Promotion Code during the Term and it is a violation of these terms and conditions for an investor to indirectly (including through entities formed for such purpose) use this Promotion Code multiple times.</p><p id="i9lvmi">The Promotion Code Program requires additional payment to make an Investment Commitment. The Promotion Code Program applies to every Offering on the Portal during the Term subject to the following restrictions.</p><p id="i4swym">A Promotion Code will not be applied and cannot be used if:</p><ol id="igbap4"><li id="implcs">the Offering is oversubscribed or using the Promotion Code would cause the Offering to be oversubscribed;</li><li id="ihpbtk">use of the Promotion Code would result in an Investor exceeding their annual investment limit, as determined by Reg. CF;</li><li id="i5zuz8">if an Offering is undersubscribed as determined by the cumulative Investment Commitments made without including any Promotion Code payments to be made on behalf of participating investors;</li><li id="iifmn4">an Investor’s Investment Commitment has been made but is not funded at the time of an Offering’s close; or</li><li>use of the Promotion Code would cause the total amount of Promotion Code payments made by the Portal in a particular Offering to exceed the disclosed cash commission of the Portal as it relates to such Offering.</li></ol><p id="icm81a">In the event an Investor applies a Promotion Code towards an Offering and either a) the Investor cancels or reduces their Investment Commitment, b) the Offering is ultimately undersubscribed or c) the Offering is ultimately withdrawn, (each a “Cancelled Investment Commitment”), the Investor will have the later of i) the Term or ii) thirty-days, from the Cancelled Investment Commitment, to use the Promotion Code.</p><p id="i7pjex">This Promotion Code can be used on the Portal solely if and when an Investor decides to subscribe to an Offering during the Term. Republic does not recommend or advise Investors to make any investments through the Portal – startup investing is risky, you are likely to lose all of the money you invest.</p><p id="i6vnow">You must be 18 years of age or older to make an Investment on the Portal, Republic reserves the right to request proof of age. Void where prohibited or restricted by law. Promotion Code terms and conditions are subject to change without notice.

Note Reward Program Conditions</h3><p id="itb0xi"><u class="u-fontWeight500">1. Membership:</u> Membership in the Note Reward program (“Program”) and the benefits of the Program are offered at the sole discretion of Republic; you have no right to be a Member and Membership does not afford you any rights or privileges not provided to a User of the Site. Eligible Users of the Site are automatically enrolled in the Program when opening a User account or have be entered into the Program retroactively. You do not need to make an investment or any purchase to be a participant in the Program. As you use the Site, you accumulate User-reward-tokens, called notes “Notes”, each individually a “Note”. Currently, Republic intends to limit the pool of Notes to reward early adopters of the Site, but reserves the right to alter or remove any limit. Upon enrolling, a Note account (“Note Account”) will be created for you. Tokens earned will accumulate in your Notes Account, as described below. Republic may provide you certain Notes in your Note Account upon the beginning of your Membership, even if you haven’t previously used the Site, subject to the same terms and conditions as earned or accumulated Notes.</p><p id="ikjupc"><u class="u-fontWeight500">2. Eligibility:</u> Only Users who have opened an account on the Site may become members (“Members”) in the Program. Currently, there is no residency requirement related to being a Member, however, Republic reserves the right to impose one, including retroactively, if the Program is impermissible under any state, federal or foreign law. Corporations, associations and other groups may not participate unless given written permission by Republic. Republic reserves the right to disqualify any person from participating as a Member if, in our sole judgment, that person appears to be violating these Conditions, or any of the Terms of the Site and Services or otherwise acting in a manner inconsistent with the Program’s intent. If a Member is disqualified, they forfeit their Note Account, the contents of such Note Account and any benefits such Note Account entitled them too.</p><p id="ik90kj"><u class="u-fontWeight500">3.

Accumulating Notes and Using Notes:</u></p><p id="iu3l1h"><u class="s-marginLeft1_5">Accumulating Notes:</u> Once enrolled in the Program, you accumulate Notes based on your Eligible Actions. Any Eligible Actions entered into by a user who is not the Member (i.e., does not have a User account on the Site) will not accumulate Notes. If we deactivate your Note Account due to our belief that your account was used to abuse or manipulate the Program, membership in the Program will terminate immediately and your Note Account Balance may be forfeited. We reserve the right, in our full discretion, to retroactively allow you to accumulate Notes for past actions; we also reserve the right to cancel any Note allocation we believe to be improper, mistaken, or otherwise impermissible under the Conditions of your Membership. For the avoidance of doubt, any Notes will be accumulated by individual Users and shall be solely issued by Republic.</p><p id="iesu6u"><u class="s-marginLeft1_5">Using Notes:</u> From time to time, we will anticipate providing opportunities for Members to use Notes, whether to redeem a Perk (defined below) or redeem a credit on the Site. Any time you use a Note, this will be reflected in your Note Account Balance and whichever Level (defined below) you have reached. We reserve the right to alter the permissible uses of Notes at any time. Notes cannot be used off of the Site, as described further in Other Terms.</p><p id="i072ps"><u class="u-fontWeight500">5. Expiration of Note Account Balance:</u> If you are not an Active User during any rolling calendar year, we reserve the right to remove all remaining Notes in your Note Account (i.e., your Note Account Balance) and return them to the claimable pool. Notes will not be halved, anything less than a full Note will be considered zero Notes. Nothing in this section will reduce Republic’s right to cancel any and all Note Account Balances held by a User at any time and for any reason.</p><p id="iwsug8"><u class="u-fontWeight500">6. Note Multiplier:</u> From time to time, we may offer incentives that allow Members to earn a greater number of Notes for an Eligible Action than they typically would. Republic does not need to announce the details of the Note Multiplier for it to be in effect. Any Note Multiplier earned will be reflected in your Note Account Balance within 48 hours of the end of the Note Multiplier period.</p><p id="ijt2i1"><u class="u-fontWeight500">7. Benefits/Perks and Levels:</u> As you earn Notes, you will gain levels (each a “Level”). Each Level unlocks certain unique benefits for Members. From time to time, Republic will provide various perks (“Perks”) which can be redeemed on the Site for certain Users who have either (i) achieved a predetermined Level or a higher Level or (ii) elected to use Notes to redeem the Perk. Perks may be limited in availability, scope or the time available to claim them. Note Rewards may not be redeemed or exchanged for cash or cash equivalents. Republic reserve the right to withdraw or reverse any Level granted to or any Perk provided to a Member.</p><p id="i3cqsb"><u class="u-fontWeight500">8. Tracking of Notes on the Ledger:</u> Your Note Account and Note Account Balance may be tracked on a private blockchain developed by Republic and its partners (the “Ledger”). The Ledger blockchain will not be publicly accessible and you will have no rights to its code or right to access it. Republic may never utilize the Ledger, discontinue use of the Ledger or alter the Ledger at any time. Should Notes ever be moved to a public decentralized ledger, you will be informed if and when you can claim such Notes.</p><p id="i26on8"><u class="u-fontWeight500">9. Termination of or Change in Program:</u> Republic may terminate the Program at any time, with or without notice, which may result in loss of your accumulated Note Account Balance and the cancellation of all benefits and privileges associated with the Program. Republic reserves the right to limit, delete or change any of the rules, terms, conditions, and benefits of the Program at its sole discretion, with or without notice. Interpretation of these Conditions shall be at the sole discretion of Republic, whose decision will be final. Republic has the right to close your Note Account for any reason.</p><p id="is4zbk"><u class="u-fontWeight500">10. Other Terms:</u> Republic is not responsible for any tax liability connected with receipt or use of any Note Reward. Each Member is responsible for any and all tax consequences related to receiving Notes or otherwise participating on Republic. The Program is void where prohibited by law. A Notes Account Balance is not transferable in the event of death, as part of a domestic relations matter, or for any other reason. The sale or barter of any Notes Account Balance is prohibited. Events beyond Republic’s control, such as computer equipment or electronic data transmission failure, hacking or other cyberattacks, strikes, acts of God, civil disturbance, terrorism, war, or other third party acts or omissions that may materially affect our ability to perform, will allow us to suspend or terminate the Program.</p><p id="isgtlj"><u class="u-fontWeight500">11. Representations and Warranties:</u> We make no warranties regarding the Note. While there may be utility in the earning or use of the Note on the Site, the Note has no value off of the Site and neither the Note nor the Note Account Balance may be transferred, used, exchanged, lent or leveraged. The Note does not entitle you to any asset, economic right, governance right, interest or other item that could lead you to expect to profit from the Note. Republic reserves the right to offer notes, points, tokens, securities or other units for sale that materially differ in their rights and privileges from the Notes, and doing so will not violate this Program’s terms or conditions. Any offer or sale of a security will be done in full compliance of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934. To be abundantly clear, you will not be entitled to any security unless and until the Company or an affiliate conducts an offering, you subscribe to such offering and the subscription is accepted; being a Note holder will not entitle or guarantee you to participate in any offering of securities hosted by the Company or an affiliate. By being a Member, you represent and warrant that you have no expectation of profit from accumulating or using the Note and that your primary motivation for accumulating Notes is to be a User on the Site.</p><p id="ijdijz"><u class="u-fontWeight500">12. Release of Information:</u> By enrolling in the Program, you consent to the release of information to third parties that assist us in carrying out the Program.</p><p id="ijd19i"><u class="u-fontWeight500">13. Change to Your Note Rewards Account Information:</u> You must advise Republic of any change in your name or the address, phone number and/or email address associated with your Note Account.

Testing the Waters Contingency for Issuers</h3><p id="iuv0kk">Pursuant to Reg. CF Rule 206, at any time before the filing of an offering statement (Form C), an issuer may communicate orally or in writing to determine whether there is any interest in a contemplated securities offering, often referred to as “testing the waters” ( “TTW” ). While TTW, no solicitation or acceptance of money or other consideration, nor of any commitment, binding or otherwise, from any person is permitted until the offering statement is filed. Further, all communications during a TTW must:</p><ol id="is8mn9"><li id="i3spbd">State that no money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response, will not be accepted;</li><li id="i020n4">State that no offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received until the offering statement is filed and only through an intermediary&#039;s platform; and</li><li>State that a person&#039;s indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind.</li></ol>Some Offerings converting from a TTW offering into a live filing offering that can accept subscriptions are conditioned on and contingent upon a Successful TTW Trial (defined below) pursuant to Reg. CF Rule 206. To fulfill the TTW Contingency (defined below), an Issuer must:<ol id="ijymjd"><li id="i86gjg">Solidify $50,000.00 of investment reservations on the Portal</li><li id="idsyxp">Within 60 business days from the date the TTW began</li><li>From 5 or more investors not affiliated with the Issuer (collectively, the “TTW Contingency” ).</li></ol><p id="iurcc9"></p><p id="ibzkok">The TTW Contingency must be met prior to the Issuer filing a Form C. Issuers that are given a TTW Contingency ( “Partaking Issuers” ) understand that this Section is applicable if, and only if, the Company was provided with a TTW Contingency, which shall be provided orally or in writing by Republic before, or contemporaneously with, a Republic Regulation Crowdfunding Offering Agreement ( “Offering Agreement” ). If a Partaking Issuer fails to meet the TTW Contingency, as determined in the sole discretion by the Portal, Partaking Issuers understand that it will be deemed a failed TTW ( “Unsuccessful TTW Trial” ) and no Form C will be filed or subscription accepted.</p><p id="ilg8hk">During the TTW, a Partaking Issuer may only take investment reservations (also called indications of interest). Unless and until the Issuer satisfies the TTW Contingency ( “Successful TTW Trial” ), the Partaking Issuer may then file a Form C with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequently, take investment commitments. In the interest of extreme clarity, Partaking Issuers understand and agree that if a TTW Contingency exists, the Partaking Issuer must experience a Successful TTW Trial prior to being eligible to convert the TTW to a full offering (i.e., filing a Form C with the SEC and soliciting investment commitments rather than investment reservations). Notwithstanding, Republic retains all rights specified herein, including the right to accept, reject, or withdraw any Offering in Republic’s sole discretion, irrespective of a Successful TTW Trial. Republic further retains all rights as specified in the offering agreement between the respective issuer and Republic.</p><p id="ifbail">Unless and until the TTW Contingency is met, the Company agrees that it will be deemed to have opted-out of being listed on the platform page (<a href="https://republic.com/companies" id="imh15y">https://republic.com/companies</a>) (the “Platform Page” ) and Republic&#039;s homepage (<a href="https://republic.com/" id="ij5fa2">https://republic.com/</a>) (the “Homepage” ).</p><p id="i97ndh">If the TTW Contingency is met, the Company may opt-in to being listed, in its sole discretion, on the Platform Page and/or Homepage.

        V.1.
          Voucher System
      </h3><p id="ijnls6-2-2">The Portal may provide single-use bonus-codes
        (“Promotion Code”) to Investors on the Portal from time to time. The Promotion Code can only
        be applied toward investment commitments (“Investment Commitments”) for an Offering hosted
        by the Portal. The following describes the terms and conditions of the Promotion Code
        program (“Promotion Code Program”).
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-3">The ability of an Investor to invest in an Offering
        on the Portal will depend on the investor’s financial circumstances and investment history,
        pursuant to the eligibility requirements of Regulation CF of the Securities Act of 1933
        (“Reg. CF”). To use the Promotion Code an Investor must have an Investor account on the
        Portal. To open an Investor account, a person has to provide certain information including
        contact information and representations regarding their income and net worth and certain
        aspects of their investment history.
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-4">Each Promotion Code (i) has an expiration date
        associated with the unique Promotion Code (the “Term”— investors can check expiration dates
        (
        <a href="https://republic.com/check-promo-code" target="_blank">here</a>) , (ii) cannot be
        transferred in any way (iii) is not reusable, and (iv) and may not be redeemed for cash
        (except as required by law). An Investor may only use one Promotion Code during the Term and
        it is a violation of these Terms for an investor to indirectly (including through entities
        formed for such purpose) use this Promotion Code multiple times.
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-5">The Promotion Code Program requires additional
        payment to make an Investment Commitment. The Promotion Code Program applies to every
        Offering on the Portal during the Term subject to the following restrictions.
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-6">A Promotion Code will not be applied and cannot be
        used if:
      </p><ol><li id="iq3cmpi">
          the Offering is oversubscribed or using the Promotion Code would cause the Offering to
          be oversubscribed;
        </li><li id="iwg010i">
          use of the Promotion Code would result in an Investor exceeding their investment limit,
          as determined by Reg. CF;
        </li><li id="iyi6q8i">
          if an Offering is undersubscribed as determined by the cumulative Investment Commitments
          made without including any Promotion Code payments to be made on behalf of participating
          investors;
        </li><li id="iju0eli">
          an Investor’s Investment Commitment has been made but is not funded at the time of an
          Offering’s close; or
        </li><li id="iucs4dh">
          use of the Promotion Code would cause the total amount of Promotion Code payments made
          by the Portal in a particular Offering to exceed the disclosed cash commission of the
          Portal as it relates to such Offering.
        </li></ol><p id="ijnls6-2-7">In the event an Investor applies
        a Promotion Code towards an Offering and either (a) the Investor cancels or reduces their
        Investment Commitment, (b) the Offering is ultimately undersubscribed or (c) the Offering is
        ultimately withdrawn, (each a “Cancelled Investment Commitment”), the Investor will have the
        later of (i) the Term or (ii) thirty-days, from the Cancelled Investment Commitment, to use
        the Promotion Code.
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-8">This Promotion Code can be used
        on the Portal solely if and when an Investor decides to subscribe to an Offering during the
        Term. Republic does not recommend or advise Investors to make any investments through the
        Portal – startup investing is risky, you are likely to lose all of the money you invest.
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-9">You must be 18 years of age or
        older to make an Investment on the Portal, Republic reserves the right to request proof of
        age. Void where prohibited or restricted by law. Promotion Code terms and conditions are
        subject to change without notice. The Promotion Code Program is governed by the laws of the
        State of New York.

        V.2.
          Autopilot Program
      </h3><p id="ijnls6-2-10">The Portal may allow Investors (“Participating
        Investors”) to participate in the autopilot investment program (“Autopilot”), a payment
        allocation and offering selection tool. Autopilot automatically selects investment
        commitments on behalf of Participating Investors in qualifying Offerings hosted by Republic
        (each, a “Portfolio Company”, and collectively, the “Portfolio Companies”) based on the
        terms and conditions of Autopilot and each Participating Investors’ Autopilot preferences
        (collectively, the “Preferences”). Participating Investors must agree to these Autopilot
        terms (collectively, the “Autopilot Program”) to participate in Autopilot and must complete
        each selected investment commitment prior to a subscription being confirmed.
      </p><br/><p id="ijnls6-2-11">Portfolio Companies must meet all of the following
        conditions to qualify for investment commitments from participants in Autopilot. The Portal
        reserves the right to change the conditions described below at any time and/or to remove a
        Portfolio Company from the Autopilot Program.
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-12">For a Portfolio Company to qualify for Autopilot, the
        following terms must be met; such Portfolio Company must have:
      </p><ul><li id="i0ad2zl">
          (i) fully funded investment commitments in excess of $150,000
        </li><li id="ibvcbwf">
          (ii) such investment commitments exceed two (2) times the relevant Target Offering
          Amount (as defined in its offering statement)
        </li><li id="imeuy35">
          (iii) such investment commitments must be from more than one hundred (100) unique
          investors*
        </li><li id="iippek3">
          (iv) sufficient allocation to accept investment commitments into the Offering (i.e.,
          investment commitments made through Autopilot will not be wait-listed)
        </li><li id="iq053zy">
          (v) at least five (5) more days in its Offering before the Offering deadline.
        </li><li id="ig3c6rw">
          (vi) securities that are priced at $1.00 per security
        </li></ul><p id="ijnls6-2-13">* Investment commitments must be fully funded to
        qualify.
      </p><br/><p id="ijnls6-2-14">Participating Investors agree, understand and
        represent to the following:
      </p><ul><li id="i1t0z7p">
          any and all representations made with respect to the Autopilot will be re-represented
          every time an investment commitment is made through Autopilot – if a Participating
          Investor becomes aware that their representations are false or if they cannot make these
          representations, such Participating Investor will immediately contact 
          <a href="mailto:investors@republic.co">Republic</a> to discontinue participation in
          Autopilot;
        </li><li id="inmm2wo">

          <a href="https://republic.com/learn/investors/how-it-works" target="_blank">
            educational materials</a> from time to time to ensure the Participating Investor is
          properly informed of the risks and procedures of Regulation Crowdfunding;
        </li><li id="i783kau">
          investment commitments can be canceled in any Portfolio Company until 48 hours prior to
          each Portfolio Company’s next closing or offering deadline;

          investing in Portfolio Companies now and in the future, when combined with all of the
          Participating Investor’s other Regulation Crowdfunding investments during any 12 month
          period on any crowdfunding portal, does not and will not exceed the Participating
          Investor’s Regulation Crowdfunding investment limit – each Participating Investor agrees
          to make timely disclosure to Republic of any Regulation Crowdfunding investments made
          through another portal to ensure to not exceed regulatory investment limits;
        </li><li id="i1hhy6y">
          investment commitments selected via Autopilot will be made exclusively based on each
          Participating Investor’s Autopilot Preferences, which include (i) the period of time to
          participate in the Program, (ii) the investment commitment amount per Portfolio Company,
          (iii) the maximum amount of Portfolio Companies to invest in per period, (iv) the total
          allocation of investment commitments with respect to any period of the Program and (v)
          the preferred payment source for investment commitments. In the event multiple Portfolio
          Companies qualify under a Participating Investor’s Preferences, an investment commitment
          will be allocated to the first Portfolio Company to qualify under my Preferences; and
        </li><li id="itrwrx8">
          Autopilot will not make investment commitments into offerings that are fully subscribed
          and are only taking oversubscription wait-list investment commitments.
        </li></ul><p id="ijnls6-2-15">In the event any terms of the Autopilot Program
        conflict with Republic’s general Terms, Republic’s general Terms shall have priority.

        V.3.
          Testing the Waters Contingency for Issuers
      </h3><p id="ijnls6-2-16">Pursuant to Reg. CF Rule 206, at any time before the
        filing of an offering statement (Form C), an issuer may communicate orally or in writing to
        determine whether there is any interest in a contemplated securities offering, often
        referred to as “testing the waters” (“TTW”). While TTW, no solicitation or acceptance of
        money or other consideration, nor of any commitment, binding or otherwise, from any person
        is permitted until the offering statement is filed. Further, all communications during a TTW
        must:
      </p><ol><li id="iywwegr">
          State that no money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response,
          will not be accepted;
        </li><li id="ipfqd1g">
          State that no offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase
          price can be received until the offering statement is filed and only through an
          intermediary&#039;s platform; and
        </li><li id="iro4c5c">
          to having reviewed the 
          <a href="https://republic.com/learn/investors/how-it-works" target="_blank">
            educational materials</a> and will review the 
          <a href="https://republic.com/learn/investors/how-it-works" target="_blank">
            educational materials</a> from time to time to ensure the Participating Investor is
          properly informed of the risks and procedures of Regulation Crowdfunding;
        </li><li id="ig7ozx4">
          State that a person&#039;s indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any
          kind.
        </li></ol><p id="ijnls6-2-17">Issuers that are TTW on the Republic Platform are
        sometimes referred to as “Reservation Campaigns.” Some Offerings converting from a TTW
        offering into a live filing offering that can accept subscriptions are conditioned on and
        contingent upon a Successful TTW Trial (defined below) pursuant to Reg. CF Rule 206. To
        fulfill the TTW Contingency (defined below), for Reservation Campaigns launched on or after October 16, 2022, an Issuer must solidify:<br/></p><ol><li id="it24m7p">Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) of investment reservations on the Portal; </li><li id="i1w1syo">Within thirty (30) business days from the date the TTW began; and</li><li id="ib7cmci">From at least five (5) investors unaffiliated with the Issuer (collectively, the “TTW
          Contingency”).
        </li></ol><p id="insemg6">For Reservation Campaigns launched prior to October 16, 2022, an Issuer must solidify: <br/><br/><ol id="i9x6avu-2" draggable="false"><li id="it24m7p-2" draggable="false" class="gjs-selected">    Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) of investment reservations on the Portal; <br/><br/></li><li id="i1w1syo-2" draggable="false" class="gjs-selected">    Within sixty (60) business days from the date the TTW began; and<br/><br/></li><li id="iq3g3wu">From at least five (5) investors unaffiliated with the Issuer.</li></ol></p><p id="ijnls6-2-18">The TTW Contingency must be met prior to the Issuer
        filing a Form C. Issuers that are given a TTW Contingency (“Partaking Issuers”) understand
        that this Section is applicable if, and only if, the Company was provided with a TTW
        Contingency, which shall be provided orally or in writing by Republic before, or
        contemporaneously with, a Republic Regulation Crowdfunding Offering Agreement (“Offering
        Agreement”). If a Partaking Issuer fails to meet the TTW Contingency, as determined in the
        sole discretion of Republic, Partaking Issuers understand that it will be deemed a failed
        TTW (“Unsuccessful TTW Trial”) and no Form C will be filed or subscription accepted.  </p><p id="ijnls6-2-19">During a Reservation Campaign, a Partaking Issuer may
        only take investment reservations (also called indications of interest). Unless and until
        the Issuer satisfies the TTW Contingency (“Successful TTW Trial”), the Partaking Issuer may
        then file a Form C with the SEC, and subsequently, begin accepting investment commitments.
        In the interest of extreme clarity, Partaking Issuers understand and agree that if a TTW
        Contingency exists, the Partaking Issuer must experience a Successful TTW Trial prior to
        being eligible to convert the TTW to a full offering (i.e., filing a Form C with the SEC and
        soliciting investment commitments rather than investment reservations). Notwithstanding,
        Republic retains all rights specified herein, including the right to accept, reject, or
        withdraw any Offering in Republic’s sole discretion, irrespective of a Successful TTW Trial.
        Republic further retains all rights as specified in the offering agreement between the
        respective issuer and Republic.
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-20">Unless and until the TTW Contingency is met, the
        Company agrees that it will be deemed to have opted-out of being listed on the platform page
        (
        <a href="https://republic.com/companies" target="_blank">https://republic.com/companies
        </a>) (the “Platform Page”) and Republic&#039;s homepage (
        <a href="https://republic.com" target="_blank">https://republic.coms </a>) (the “Homepage”).
      </p><p id="ijnls6-2-21">If the TTW Contingency is met, the Company may opt-in
        to being listed, in its sole discretion, on the Platform Page and/or Homepage. The company
        must and will be listed on a web page listing all active Reg. CF offerings (“All Companies
        Page”) (
        <a href="https://republic.com/reg-cf-offerings" target="_blank">https://republic.com/reg-cf-offerings </a>) when a Form C is filed.

          Portal Binding Arbitration
      </h3><p id="ijnls6-2-22">If you and the Portal are unable to resolve a Dispute
        through informal negotiations, either you or the Company may elect to have the Dispute
        (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding
        arbitration in accordance with the rules of FINRA DR. Any election to arbitrate by one party
        shall be final and binding on the other. You thereby agree to arbitrate any controversy or
        claim before FINRA DR in the State of New York. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION,
        YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

          Securities sold through the Republic Platform may not necessarily be publicly traded

          subject to restrictions on resale or transfer, including holding period requirements.
          Investing in Investment Opportunities offered on the Republic Platform requires high
          risk tolerance, low liquidity need, and long-term commitments. Investors must be able to
          afford to lose their entire investment. Securities are not FDIC insured, may lose value,

          ERA Dispute Resolution
      </h3><ol type="a"><li id="ix5xtjn"><u>Arbitrator.
          </u>
            Any arbitration between you and Republic Deal Room Advisor will be governed by
          the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and
          Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “
          <b>AAA
            Rules
          </b>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“
          <b>AAA
          </b>”), as modified by
          this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
          available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting
          Republic Deal Room Advisor. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any
          dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding
          arbitration agreement.
        </li><li id="i3wkkxo"><u>Notice; Process.
          </u>
           A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the
          dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (“
          <b>Notice
          </b>”). Republic Deal Room Advisor’
          address for Notice is: Republic Deal Room Advisor ATTN: Legal Department, Republic Deal
          Room Advisor, 149 5th Avenue, Suite 2E, New York, NY 10010 or by email at 
          <a href="mailto:legal@republicdealroom.com" target="_blank"> legal@republicdealroom.co
          </a> Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the
          claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties
          will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not
          reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, then
          you or Republic Deal Room Advisor may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
          arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Republic Deal Room
          Advisor must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final
          decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in
          your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered
          by Republic Deal Room Advisor prior to selection of an arbitrator, then Republic Deal
          Room Advisor will pay you the highest of the following: (1) the amount awarded by the
          arbitrator, if any; (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Republic Deal Room
          Advisor in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) $15,000.
        </li><li id="ikuz2xh"><u>Fees.
          </u>
            If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, then Republic Deal
          Room Advisor will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is
          for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will
          be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be
          agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then
          you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of
          documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone
          hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county
          (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance
          of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
          purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
          11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case,
          you agree to reimburse Republic Deal Room Advisor for all monies previously disbursed by
          it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the
          manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned
          written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
          the decision and award, if any, are based. Each party agrees that such written decision,
          and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the
          extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The
          arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of
          fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party
          made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
        </li><li id="i1dba58"><u>No Class Action.
          </u>
            YOU AND REPUBLIC DEAL ROOM ADVISOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
          OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
          ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Republic
          Deal Room Advisor agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
          person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
          class proceeding.
        </li><li id="i3oso8t"><u>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.
          </u>
            Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if Republic Deal Room Advisor
          makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Republic
          Deal Room Advisor’ address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending us
          written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Republic Deal Room Advisor’
          address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
          prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and
          Republic Deal Room Advisor.
        </li><li id="igj4979"><u>Indemnification.
          </u>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold
          harmless the Republic Deal Room Advisor Parties from and against any claims, actions or
          demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or

          of the Republic Deal Room Advisor Content, Trademarks, or any part of the Site; or (c)
          any false, inaccurate, or misleading information you provide to Republic Deal Room
          Advisor. Republic Deal Room Advisor will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit,
          or proceeding. Republic Deal Room Advisor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
          assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to
          indemnification under this Section at your sole expense if Republic Deal Room Advisor
          believes that you are unwilling or incapable of defending Republic Deal Room Advisor’
          interests. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting
          Republic Deal Room Advisor’ defense of such matter at your sole expense. Notwithstanding
          the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver by any
          Investor of any of his, her, or its legal rights under applicable U.S. federal
          securities laws or any other laws whose applicability is not permitted to be
          contractually waived.

        is: Republic Core LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, Republic, 149 E 23rd St #2001, New York,

        good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an

        of an arbitrator, then Republic Core will pay you the highest of the following: (1) the
        amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (2) the last written settlement amount offered
        by Republic Core in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3)
        $15,000.
