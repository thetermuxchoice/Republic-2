Republic may also provide you with a digital asset wallet (for Republic Notes and
other types of digital assets, which integrate with and/or are based on independent
third party blockchain platform(s) (e.g., the Algorand blockchain service platform)
(“Republic Wallet”), subject to our policies, procedures, and documentation relating
to the Republic Wallet.  Blockchain related technologies, platforms, and services
are decentralized and supported by independent third parties, which we do not own,
control, or operate.  The Republic Wallet is a tool designed to facilitate your
management and use of digital assets relying on the blockchain, but does not
eliminate the risks relating to the blockchain and related digital assets,
which you should independently assess and which we disclaim liability for under
this Agreement. Subject to the other provisions of this Section and the Agreement,
including Sections 11 and 15, you can manage and/or facilitate holding, tracking,
sending, and/or receiving your Republic Note holdings and/or other eligible
blockchain digital assets through your Republic Wallet, although certain
features may be limited, and features may be added or removed,
from time to time. In addition, for regulatory and risk reasons, as determined
by Republic Core in its sole discretion, certain prohibitions or restrictions may
apply to your Republic Notes and/or other digital assets and may be hardwired into
the Republic Wallet or otherwise limited. The Republic Wallet is powered through our
partnership with independent third parties, which may include Aikon, Comakery, Coincover,
and Wyre, who we do not control and are not responsible. The Republic Wallet may also
be linked to other accounts you provide as and if supported by the Republic Wallet. We
do not guarantee or ensure assets or transactions relating to the blockchain or the third
party platforms, services, or partners described above or otherwise underlying the
Republic Wallet, or digital assets. By using the Republic Wallet, you acknowledge and
agree that the transaction details you submit or request may not be completed, or may
be substantially delayed, by third parties or other factors outside of our control.
Also, third party valuations, fees, costs, and/or amounts are non-binding estimates
(unless expressly provided otherwise), and actuals may vary based on factors,
including, but not limited to, network congestion, delays, or other fluctuations.
The Republic Wallet is non-custodial -- it does not store or transmit digital assets,
but is designed to help you facilitate your management and certain transactions relating
to digital assets, and related third party services which are also subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, including Sections 11 and 15.  You are responsible
for being the custodian of your digital assets, and how you set up the Wallet will impact
its functions and features.  See our on-line documentation for more details, which
are subject to change.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your passwords, private keys,
and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Republic Wallet and related digital
assets. You must keep that information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss
of control of the underlying assets or transfers. We generally cannot assist with retrieval
of passwords, keys, phrases, or other information outside of our possession or control,
including blockchain related passwords and keys. If you have not safely stored a backup or
fail to remember, you accept and acknowledge that digital assets may become inaccessible
and unrecoverable by you, and you agree we are not responsible for that in any way.
You are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or
control of your Republic Wallet and related digital assets.

5. Investment Opportunities
</h2>
<ol class='static_pages-core_terms__list-alpha'>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
Federal securities law requires securities sold in the United
States to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("<strong class='u-textDecorationUnderline'>SEC</strong>"), unless the sale qualifies for an exemption.
The securities offered on the Site for U.S. investments have not
been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance on the
exemptions provided under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
Rule 506 of Regulation D, Regulation A, and/or Regulation S,
promulgated thereunder. All subscription funds are held in escrow
until a campaign successfully achieves its goal and the investment
round is closed.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
Investment overviews on the Site contain summaries of the purpose
and principal terms of the Investment Opportunities. Such
summaries are intended for informational purposes only, are not
intended as a promise or indication of future results or
performance and do not purport to be complete, and each is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed
discussions contained in the investor document package relating
to such Investment Opportunity.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
The securities offered on the Site are only suitable for
prospective investors who are familiar with and willing to accept
the high risks associated with Investment Opportunities,
including the risk of complete loss of your investment.
Securities sold through the Site may not necessarily be publicly
traded and, therefore, may be illiquid unless registered with the
SEC. Such securities will be subject to restrictions on resale or
transfer including holding period requirements. Investing in
Investment Opportunities offered on the Site requires high risk
tolerance, low liquidity need, and long-term commitments.
Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.
Securities are not deposits into an account, not FDIC insured, may
lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
No governmental agency has reviewed the Investment Opportunities
posted on this Site and no state or federal agency has passed
upon either the adequacy of the disclosure or the fairness of the
terms of any Investment Opportunity.
<strong>
NEITHER REPUBLIC CORE NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES PROVIDE LEGAL
ADVICE, GENERALLY AND WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ON
THE SITE. WE STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO CONSULT A LEGAL, TAX AND
FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL BEFORE INVESTING, AND CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL
THE SPECIFIC RISK DISCLOSURES PROVIDED AS PART OF ANY INVESTMENT
OFFERING DOCUMENTS AND ASK REPUBLIC CORE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY
HAVE OR REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
Republic Core is not a registered broker-dealer, funding portal,
investment adviser or investment manager, and does not offer
investment advice or advise on the raising of capital through
Investment Opportunities. Republic Core does not recommend or
otherwise suggest that any Investor make an investment in a
particular Investment Opportunity. If a registered broker-dealer,
financial advisor or other intermediary receiving compensation
is participating in an Investment Opportunity, such participation
will be clearly disclosed in the relevant Investment
Offering Documents.

If you are located outside of the United States, you use or
access the Site solely at your own risk and initiative. The Site
is controlled and operated from facilities within the United

appropriate or available for use in any other jurisdictions.
Accessing the Site is prohibited from territories where the
content on the Site is prohibited. Investment Opportunities are
only directed at, or intended for purchase or investment by,
investors in jurisdictions that permit general solicitation of

</li>
<li>
The content, material and information contained on the Site does
not constitute an offer or solicitation and may not be treated as
an offer or solicitation to sell securities referred to on this
Site (i) by anyone in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation is against the law; (ii) to anyone to whom it is
unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation; or (iii) if the
person making the offer or solicitation is not qualified to do
so. The securities offered on this Site can only be marketed in
certain jurisdictions only. You acknowledge and agree that it is
solely your responsibility to be aware of and to observe all the
applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction,
including the one in which you reside. You should satisfy
yourself before accessing the Site that we would be allowed to
advertise investment products to you under the law of the
jurisdiction in which you reside. Subscriptions to invest in any
Investment Opportunity referred to on this Site must only be made
on the basis of the Investment Offering Documents relating to
that specific Investment Opportunity.

6. Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce

</h2>
<ol class='static_pages-core_terms__list-alpha'>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
The Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ("<strong class='u-textDecorationUnderline'>ESIGN</strong>")
and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ("<strong class='u-textDecorationUnderline'>UETA</strong>"),
authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable
agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. ESIGN and
UETA require businesses that want to use electronic records or
signatures in consumer transactions to obtain the consumer’s
consent to receive information electronically. When a potential
investor registers on the Site, we obtain his, her or its consent
to transact business electronically and maintain electronic
records in compliance with ESIGN and UETA requirements.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
Your use of electronic signatures to sign documents on the Site,
including, without limitation, subscription agreements for
Investment Opportunities and related Investment Offering
Documents, legally binds you in the same manner as if you had
manually signed such documents. No certification authority or
third-party verification is necessary to validate any electronic
signature and the lack of such certification or verification will
not in any way affect the enforceability of such signatures or
documents. The use of electronic versions of such documents fully
satisfies any requirement that such documents be provided to you
in writing. If you sign electronically, you represent that you
have the ability to access and retain a record of such documents.
You agree that you are responsible for understanding these
documents and agree to conduct business by electronic means. You
are obligated to review the Site periodically for changes and
modifications and agree not to contest the admissibility or
enforceability of the Site’s electronically stored copies of
these documents or this Agreement in any proceeding arising out
of these documents or this Agreement.
</li>
<li>
Although you consent to electronic delivery, you may elect to
deliver communications by other means and such delivery shall not
affect your consent. You may revoke consent to electronic
delivery of communications and receive a paper version at your
election. Republic Core shall have a reasonable period to effect
such a change and Republic Core may charge you a reasonable fee
for sending such paper copies. If you elect to use electronic
delivery, you agree and represent that you have a suitable
computer with Internet access, an email address and the
availability to download, save and/or print communications to
retain a record of such communications. You agree that you are
solely responsible for maintaining such equipment and services
required for online access.

9. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Intellectual Property Infringements
</h2>
<ol class='static_pages-core_terms__list-alpha'>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
<strong>
Respect of Third-Party Rights.
</strong>
Republic Core respects the intellectual property of others and
takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and
we ask our Users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be
tolerated on or through the Site.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
<strong>
Repeat Infringer Policy.
</strong>
Republic Core’s intellectual property policy is to (i) remove or
disable access to material that Republic Core believes in good
faith or upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his
or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a
third-party by being made available through the Site; and (ii)
remove any User Content uploaded to the Site by “repeat
infringers.” Republic Core considers a “repeat infringer” to be
any User that has uploaded User Content or Feedback (as defined
in Section ‎11) to or through the Site and for whom Republic Core
has received more than two takedown notices in compliance with
the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User
Content or Feedback. Republic Core has discretion, however, to
terminate the Profile of any User after receipt of a single
notification of claimed infringement or upon Republic Core’s own
determination.

<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
<strong>
Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.

below. Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by
Republic Core with the User alleged to have infringed a right you
own or control, and you hereby consent to Republic Core making
such disclosure. Your communication must include substantially

of claimed infringement.

Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and
inform that person that Republic Core will replace the removed
User Content or Feedback or cease disabling access to it in 10
business days, and Republic Core will replace the removed User
Content or Feedback and cease disabling access to it not less
than ten (10), nor more than fourteen (14), business days

General.
</strong>
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Republic
Core in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and
Republic Core agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way
related to this Agreement or your use of the Site will be
resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than
a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead
of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in
court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court
can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all
claims arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or
your use of the Site, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and
regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the
termination of this Agreement.
<strong>
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT,
YOU AND REPUBLIC CORE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND
GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.

Notwithstanding Section ‎13(a) above, nothing in this Agreement
will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of

<strong>
Arbitrator.
</strong>
Any arbitration between you and Republic Core will be governed by
the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution
Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
Disputes (collectively, "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") of the American Arbitration
Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be
administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
1-800-778-7879 or by contacting Republic Core. The arbitrator has
exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding
arbitration agreement.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
<strong>
Notice; Process.
</strong>
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (“Notice”).
Republic Core’s address for Notice is: Republic Core Publishing,
Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, Republic, 149 E 23rd St #2001, New
York, NY 10010 or by email at
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="mailto:legal@republic.co">legal@republic.co</a>
Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature
and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the
specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good
faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties
do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after
the Notice is received, then you or Republic Core may commence an
arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any
settlement offer made by you or Republic Core must not be
disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally
resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award
that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by
Republic Core prior to selection of an arbitrator, then Republic
Core will pay you the highest of the following: (1) the amount
awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (2) the last written
settlement amount offered by Republic Core in settlement of the
dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) $15,000.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
<strong>
Fees.
</strong>
If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement,
then Republic Core will reimburse you for your payment of the
filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as
set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be
decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take
place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco,
California, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you
may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i)
solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator;
(ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii)
by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the
county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator
finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be
governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse
Republic Core for all monies previously disbursed by it that
are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision
sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
which the decision and award, if any, are based. Each party
agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged
during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the
extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review
of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve
disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or
expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request
from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s
ruling on the merits.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
<strong>
No Class Actions.
</strong>
<br>
<strong>
YOU AND REPUBLIC CORE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
</strong>
Further, unless both you and Republic Core agree otherwise, the
arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and
may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
class proceeding.
</li>
<li class='s-marginBottom1'>
<strong>
Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.
</strong>
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if Republic Core
makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than
a change to Republic Core’s address for Notice, then you may
reject the change by sending us written notice within thirty (30)
days of the change to Republic Core’s address for Notice, in
which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any
disputes between you and Republic Core.

Enforceability.
